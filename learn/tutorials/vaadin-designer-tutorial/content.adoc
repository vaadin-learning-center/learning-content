In this tutorial, you learn how to build an application with Vaadin Designer, including how to create new views, layout components, adjust CSS, and integrate the views to the backend. This is a hands-on tutorial, so you can read the explanation and follow the steps to build the same application.

[#set-up-development-environment]
== Setting up a Java development environment

Before you can start developing your Java app, you need to install the necessary tools and set up your development environment. You can follow the tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/setting-up-a-java-development-environment[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin - Setting up a Java development environment] to get your Java development environment in place.

If you already have a working Java development environment, including a JDK, Maven, Git, Node.js, and an IDE, you can skip this step and proceed to set up a Vaadin project. This tutorial expects that you are using IntelliJ IDEA, but everything is available for Eclipse as well.

[#install-designer]
== Installing Vaadin Designer

Vaadin Designer is a plug-in for your Integrated development environment (IDE). It exists for both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse. You can follow the instructions below on how to install the plug-in. If you followed the "Setting up a Java development environment" tutorial above, then you have the IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE.

[#install-chrome]
== Installing Google Chrome

When you open up a design file with Designer, the source code is shown in the IDE, while the visual editor opens up in the Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome installed, follow https://www.google.com/chrome/[the instructions to install it on your computer].

[#set-up-vaadin-project]
== Set up a Vaadin project

The first step in any development project is to set up the project and get a base app running. The tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/importing-running-and-debugging-a-java-maven-project-in-intellij-idea[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin - Importing, running, and debugging a Java web app project] shows you how to get a Vaadin project up and running on your computer, ready to be developed further.

If you already have a new Vaadin project, or want to add Designer to your existing Vaadin project, you can skip this step and proceed to Installing Vaadin Designer. 

[#start-building]
== Start building the application

With IntelliJ running and a project available, we can take our first steps towards building our first views with Designer.

. Delete the file MainView.java in src/main/java/com/vaadin/tutorial/crm
. In the Project tree, expand the frontend and src folders
. Right click on the src folder, and select New > Directory. Give the directory name "views" and press ok. 
. Right click on the newly created view folder, select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. In the "Java package" field, press the folder selection button and navigate to com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.
. In the "Name" field, type `main-view`.
. Press ok to generate the files.

Designer opens up in Google Chrome.

[#getting-familiar-with-the-ui]
== Getting familiar with the UI
Designer consists of four main parts: canvas, palette, outline and properties.

*Canvas* is where the UI your are building is rendered. It shows you what your view will look like. Before you have any components added to your view, the canvas will propose a set of starting points for your newly created view.

*Palette* is a list of components that you have available for use. The list is divided in multiple sections:

- HTML elements are the built in elements of the HTML language, like <p>, <h1> and <div>.
- Parts is a list of all the web components available in your project. These are scanned from the node_modules folder in your project automatically. If you add a new 3rd party web component to your project, it will show up in the parts list and be available for use.
- Components are snippets for Vaadin's components that give you handy commonly used configurations, like having a button with an icon and caption. 
- Patterns are preconfigured view parts  

*Outline* shows your what components are in use in the view as well as their hierarchy.

*Properties* is where you modify how a single component will look like.

[#create-the-main-layout]
== Creating the main layout

image::app-complete.png[A web application with a listing of contacts and an editor open.]

This is the layout that we are going to build.

We can note that at the root of the view we need vertical layout. At the top is a horizontal layout with for a filtering text field as well as a button to add new entries. Below we have a horizontal layout for a grid of data entries and a form. Let's disregard the form for now, as we will will build it separately, and add the rest of the components to the view.

[#add-the-components]
=== Adding all the components.
. On the canvas, click on "Vertical" to get a vertical layout as your starting point. Your view constists now of an empty layout.
. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette. Drag it twice on top of the vaadin-vertical-layout in the outline.
. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  A easy way to find components is to use the search field at the top of the palette. Drag "Vaadin Text Field" on top of the *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout in the outline.
. Find "Button" in the palette.  Drag "Button" on top of your *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout in the outline.
. Find "vaadin-grid" in the palette. Drag it on top of your *second* vaadin-horizontal-layout in the outline.

Our view is not looking like planned yet, but it has the components we need. Let's continue with configuring the components to look correct.

[#configure-main-layout]
=== Configuring the main layout
For the main layout, we want to add a bit of space between the components as well as around the layout to make it look nicer. 

. Click on you top level layout, vaadin-vertical-layout in your outline.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the padding selector and select "M". This will add some space around the main layout, letting the design breath a bit.
. In the same panel, open the spacing selector and select "M". This will add space between the toolbar and the grid.

[#configure-toolbar]
=== Configuring the toolbar
For the toolbar, we have to configure the texts to be correct. 

. Click on the text field for filtering values, vaadin-text-field
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the attribute called "label". Remove the value from it. We do not have a separate label as we have the description as the placeholder value for the field.
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the placeholder attribute. Remove the "Placeholder" value and replace it with "Filter by name..."
. Click on the button, vaadin-button.
. In the properties view, find the text panel at the top. Remove the default text "Button" and replace it with "Add contact".

[#space-for-grid]
=== Make the Grid take all the space available
We want to give the Grid the rest of the screen space, to show as much data as possible.

. Click on the lower horizontal layout, vaadin-horizontal-layout. 
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the width and height fields. Choose "100%" in both of them to expand the layout to take all the space available.
. Click on the Grid, vaadin-grid.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, put width and height fields to "100%" to give all the space from the layout to the grid.

Now our main layout looks great, but it is still missing the form.

[#create-form]
== Creating the form
It is good to keep designs focused on one thing and split them up to smaller things if there starts to be too much focus areas in one view. Let's create the form for the view in an own design. In it we want to create a Form Layout for our Contact entity.

The view we want to create looks like this.

[#form-create-design]
=== Create a new Design file.

. Switch window back to IntelliJ.
. In the Project window, right click on the frontend/src/views folder. Select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. In the "Java package" field, press the folder selection button and navigate to com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.
. In the "Name" field, type `contact-form`.
. Press ok to generate the files.
. The design opens up in the browser. In the Palette view, Search for "vaadin-form". Drag  vaadin-form-layout on top of the drop section in the canvas.

Our form component will have:

* Text fields for the first and last name.
* An email field.
* Two select fields: one to select the company and the other to select the contact status.

[#form-add-text-fields]
=== Addi two text fields for the name

. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  Drag "Vaadin Text Field" twice, on top of vaadin-form-layout.
. Click on the first vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "First name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.
. Click on the second vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "Last name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.

[#form-add-email-field]
=== Add the email field

. Find "vaadin-email-field" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and type in "Email".

[#form-add-combo-boxes]
=== Add company and status fields

. Find "vaadin-combo-box" in the palette.  Drag it, twice, on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Click on the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Company".
. Click on the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Status".

[#form-add-buttons]
=== Add buttons

We want to add buttons for save, delete and close to the form. Save is the primary action and should be highlighted. Delete can be a dangerous action and should be marked as error. Close button is not an important action and can be downlplayed with a tertiary styling.

. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Find the Vaadin button -section in the palette.  Under it drag three different buttons on top of the horizontal layout. First a "Primary Button", then a "Primary Error Button" next to it, and finally a "Tertiary Button" next to it.
. Click on the Primary button. Replace the text of the button to "Save".
. Click on the Primary Error button. Replace the text of the button to "Delete". Under Attributes, change the theme attribute from "primary error" to "error".
. Click on the Tertiary button. Replace the text of the button to "Close".

Now our form is done.

[#add-form-to-main-view]
== Add the form to the main view

We can go back to our main view and add it next to the Grid. You should have the main-view Design open in a second tab in Chrome. If you do not, reopen the main-view.js file again in IntelliJ.

In the palette, there should now be a secion called Project Components. Under it are listed other designs that you have created. By dragging from here, you can embed other designs into the one that is currently open.

. With main-view Designer open, locate contact-form in Project Components in the palette.
. Drag contact-form on top of the second vaadin-horizontal-layout.

[#size-grid-and-form]
=== Sizing grid and form

We want to give most of the space to the grid. We will use flex sizing for it, to give a 2:1 ratio between the grid and the form.

. Select vaadin-grid from the outline. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Add to the end of the value "flex: 2;".
. Select contact-form from the outline. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Set the value to "flex: 1;".


Now our layout is done.

[#add-route-to-main-view]
== Add the route to the main view.

As we replaced the MainView with our own, it doesn't have a route annotation anymore. Let's add back the root route to point towards MainView.

. Switch back to IntelliJ
. Expand the package src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui and open the file MainView.
. Add `@Route("")` annotation to the top MainView class.

[#run-the-project]
== Run the project

Let's run the project and see how the new layout looks like.

. Build the project build either pressing the green hammer in the top right, or by selecting Build -> Build Project from the menu.
. If you do not have the server running anymore, run the application by pressing the green bug in the top right, or by selecting Run -> Debug 'Application' from the menu.
. Point your browser towards http://localhost:8080/ to see the result.
