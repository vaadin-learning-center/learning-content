[#set-up-development-environment]
== Setting up a Java development environment

Before you can start developing your Java app, you need to install the necessary tools and set up your development environment. You can follow the tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/setting-up-a-java-development-environment[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin - Setting up a Java development environment] to get your Java development environment in place.

If you already have a working Java development environment, including a JDK, Maven, Git, Node.js, and an IDE, you can skip this step and proceed to set up a Vaadin project. This tutorial expects that you are using IntelliJ IDEA, but everything is available for Eclipse as well.

[#install-designer]
== Installing Vaadin Designer

Vaadin Designer is a plug-in for your Integrated development environment (IDE). It exists for both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse. You can follow the instructions below on how to install the plug-in. If you followed the "Setting up a Java development environment" tutorial above, then you have the IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE.

* https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/designer/getting-started/designer-installing-idea.html[Installing Vaadin Designer in IntelliJ IDEA]
* https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/designer/getting-started/designer-installing-eclipse.html[Installing Vaadin Designer in Eclipse]

[#install-chrome]
== Installing Google Chrome

When you open a design file with Designer, the source code is shown in the IDE, while the visual editor opens up in the Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome installed, follow https://www.google.com/chrome/[the instructions to install it on your computer].

[#set-up-vaadin-project]
== Set up a Vaadin project

The first step in any development project is to set up a project and get it running. The tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin], chapters 3-5, shows you how to get a Vaadin project up and running on your computer, ready to be developed further.

Follow chapters 3-5 in the tutorial to get the project that we will continue using with Vaadin Designer.

Alternatively, if you want to skip following the Vaadin tutorial, and continue with the Vaadin Designer tutorial, you can download the end result of Chapter 5 directly. You can https://github.com/vaadin-learning-center/crm-tutorial/archive/03-database-and-backend.zip[download the project as a zip from GitHub].

[#start-building]
== Start building the application

With IntelliJ IDEA running and a project available, we can take our first steps towards building our first views with Designer.

. Delete the file `MainView.java` in `src/main/java/com/vaadin/tutorial/crm/ui`
. In the Project tree, expand the `frontend/src` folder
. Right click on the `frontend/src` folder, and select New > Directory. Give the new directory the name `views`.
. Right click on the newly created view folder, select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. In the "Java package" field, press the folder selection button and navigate to `com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui`.
. In the "Name" field, type `main-view`.

Now, the "New Vaadin 10+ design" dialog should look as in the following image.

image::create-view.png[Creating the main view.]

Press OK to generate the files.

Next, Vaadin Designer will open in Google Chrome.

[#getting-familiar-with-the-ui]
== Getting familiar with the UI
Designer consists of four main parts: paper, palette, outline and properties.

*Paper* is where the UI you are building is rendered. It shows you what your view will look like. Before you have any components added to your view, the paper will propose a set of starting points for your newly created view.

*Palette* is a list of components that you have available for use. The list is divided in multiple sections:

- HTML elements are the built in elements of the HTML language, like `<p>`, `<h1>` and `<div>`.
- Parts is a list of all the web components available in your project. These are scanned from the node_modules folder in your project automatically. If you add a new 3rd party web component to your project, it will show up in the parts list and be available for use.
- Components are snippets for Vaadin's components that give you handy commonly used configurations, like having a button with an icon and caption. 
- Project components are the other designs in your project. You can include them into your current view.
- Patterns are preconfigured view parts  

*Outline* shows you what components are in use in the view as well as their hierarchy.

*Properties* is where you modify how a single component will look and behave.

[#create-the-main-layout]
== Creating the main layout

image::app-complete.png[A web application with a listing of contacts and an editor open.]

This is the layout that we are going to build.

We can note that at the root of the view we need a vertical layout. At the top is a horizontal layout with a text field for filtering as well as a button to add new entries. Below we have a horizontal layout for a grid of data entries and a form. Let's disregard the form for now, as we will will build it separately, and add the rest of the components to the view.

[#add-the-components]
=== Adding all the components
. On the paper, click on "Vertical" to get a vertical layout as your starting point. Your view constists now of an empty layout.
. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette. An easy way to find components is to use the search field at the top of the palette. Drag it twice on top of the vaadin-vertical-layout on the paper.
. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  Drag "Vaadin Text Field" on top of the *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout.
. Find "Button" in the palette.  Drag "Button" on top of the *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout.
. Find "vaadin-grid" in the palette. Drag it on top of the *second* vaadin-horizontal-layout.

image::adding-all-the-components.png[Components added to the view.]

Our view is not looking like planned yet, but it has the components we need. Let's continue with configuring the components to look correct.

[#configure-main-layout]
=== Configuring the main layout
For the main layout, we want to add a bit of space between the components as well as around the layout to make it look nicer. 

. Select the top level layout, by clicking on any of the empty space of the vertical layout.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the padding selector and select "M". This will add some space around the main layout, letting the design breath a bit.
. In the same panel, open the spacing selector and select "M". This will add space between the toolbar and the grid.

image::configuring-the-main-layout.png[Spacing and padding added to the main layout.]

[#configure-toolbar]
=== Configuring the toolbar
For the toolbar, we have to configure the texts to be correct. 

. Select the text field.
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the attribute called "label". Remove the value from it. We do not have a separate label as we have the description as the placeholder value for the field.
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the placeholder attribute. Remove the "Placeholder" value and replace it with "Filter by name..."
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the clear-button-visible attribute. Enable the checkbox. This will give the users an easy way to clear the filter.
. Select the button.
. In the properties view, find the text panel at the top. Remove the default text "Button" and replace it with "Add contact".

image::configuring-the-toolbar.png[Toolbar has the correct texts.]

[#space-for-grid]
=== Make the Grid take all the space available
We want to give the Grid the rest of the screen space, to show as much data as possible.

. Select the lower horizontal layout, vaadin-horizontal-layout. 
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the width and height fields. Choose "100%" in both of them to expand the layout to take all the space available.
. Select the Grid, vaadin-grid.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, put width and height fields to "100%" to give all the space from the layout to the grid.

image::space-for-grid.png[Toolbar has the correct texts.]

Now our main layout looks great, but it is still missing the form.

[#create-form]
== Creating the form
It is good to keep designs focused on one thing and split them up to smaller things if there starts to be too many focus areas in one view. Let's create the form for the view in an own design. In it we want to create a Form Layout for editing a single contact's information.

[#form-create-design]
=== Create a new Design for the form

. Switch back to IntelliJ IDEA.
. In the Project window, right click on the `frontend/src/views` folder. Select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. Verify that the Java package is `com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui`.
. In the "Name" field, type `contact-form`.
. Press ok to generate the files.
. The design opens up in the browser. In the Palette view, Search for "vaadin-form". Drag vaadin-form-layout on top of the drop section in the canvas.

image::form-create-design.png[New design for the form.]

Our form component will have:

* Text fields for the first and last name.
* An email field.
* Two select fields: one to select the company and the other to select the contact status.

[#form-add-text-fields]
=== Add two text fields for the name

. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  Drag "Vaadin Text Field" twice, on top of vaadin-form-layout.
. Select the first vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attributes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "First name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.
. Select the second vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "Last name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.

NOTE: If your paper is wide, the text fields will line up horizontally. You can make the paper narrower by dragging its left or right edge. When the paper is narrow enough, the form fields will stack vertically. This behaviour comes from vaadin-form-layout which, by default, arranges its fields into one or two columns depending on its width.

[#form-add-email-field]
=== Add the email field

. Find "vaadin-email-field" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and type in "Email".

[#form-add-combo-boxes]
=== Add company and status fields

. Find "vaadin-combo-box" in the palette.  Drag it, twice, on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Select the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Company".
. Select the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Status".

[#form-add-buttons]
=== Add buttons

We want to add buttons for save, delete and close to the form. Save is the primary action and should be highlighted. Delete can be a dangerous action and should be marked as error. Close button is not an important action and can be downlplayed with a tertiary styling.

. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Find the Vaadin button -section in the palette.  Under it drag three different buttons on top of the horizontal layout. First a "Primary Button", then a "Primary Error Button" next to it, and finally a "Tertiary Button" next to it.
. Select the Primary button. Replace the text of the button to "Save".
. Select the Primary Error button. Replace the text of the button to "Delete". 
. Under Attributes, change the theme attribute from "primary error" to "error".
. Select the Tertiary button. Replace the text of the button to "Close".

Now our form is done.

image::form-create-design-finished.png[Finished form.]

[#add-form-to-main-view]
== Add the form to the main view

We can go back to our main view and add the contact form next to the Grid. You should have the `main-view` design open in a second tab in Chrome. If you do not, reopen the `main-view.js` file again in IntelliJ IDEA.

In the palette, there is now a section called Project Components. Under it are listed other designs that you have created. By dragging from there, you can embed other designs into the one that is currently open.

. With `main-view` Designer open, locate contact-form in Project Components in the palette.
. Drag contact-form on top of the second vaadin-horizontal-layout.

image::add-form-to-main-view.png[Form embedded in main view.]

[#size-grid-and-form]
=== Sizing grid and form

We want to give most of the space to the grid. We will use flex sizing for it, to give a 2:1 ratio between the grid and the form.

. Select vaadin-grid. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Add to the end of the value "flex: 2;".
. Select contact-form. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Set the value to "flex: 1;".

Now our layout is done.

image::size-grid-and-form.png[Form embedded in main view.]

[#add-route-to-main-view]
== Add the route to the main view

As we replaced the MainView with our own, it doesn't have a route annotation anymore. Let's add back the root route to point towards MainView.

. Switch back to IntelliJ IDEA
. Expand the package `src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui` and open the file `MainView.java`.
. Add `@Route("")` annotation to the top MainView class.

Our `MainView` class should now look like this:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.js")
@Route("") <1>
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {
    // The rest of the file is omitted from the code snippet
}
----
<1> Route annotation mapping http://localhost:8080/ to MainView

[#layout-finished-run-the-project]
== Run the project

Let's run the project and see how the new layout looks like.

The easiest way to run the project for the first time is to:

. Open the Application Java class in `src/main/java/com/vaadin/tutorial/crm/Application.java`
. Click the green play button next to the line that starts with "public class Application".
+
image::running-the-app-for-the-first-time.png[Running the project from the Application class.]

This will start the application, as well as automatically add a run configuration for it into IntelliJ IDEA. Later, when you want to run or restart the application, you can build, run/restart, stop and debug the application from IDEA's toolbar:

image::intellij-toolbar-run-configurations.png[Running the project from the toolbar.]

When the build is finished, and the application is running, point your browser towards `http://localhost:8080/` to see the result.

image::layout-finished-run-the-project.png[The application running in the browser.]

[#java-connect]
== Connect your view to Java 

When building a view with Designer, you have two main files per view. One is the template file `main-view.js`, where you lay out the components and define everything that is static. The other part is `MainView.java`, which uses the template and adds UI logic as well as configures all parts that are dynamic. We call this file as the companion file for the template. When we created the views earlier in this tutorial, in the "New Vaadin 10+ Design" dialog, we checked the field "Create Java Componanion file". That gave us the files `MainView.java` and `ContactForm.java`. Adding Java code to your views will not be visible in the template when run in Designer, but it will be used when you run your application.

For the main view, in the companion file, we need to

. load data to the Grid
. filter data based on the text field
. populate the contact form when user selects a row in the grid
. enable adding new contacts using the "Add contact" button

In the contact form, we need to

. bind fields with a contact object given by the main view
. implement the buttons save, delete and close.

Let's start with loading data into the Grid.

[#java-export-components]
=== Export components to Java

Next up we will export the components that needs data or interaction to Java. For that we have to tell Designer which components we want to have available from Java code. For the main view, we need the Grid for showing data, the text field for filtering and the button for adding new contacts.

. Open `main-view.js` in Designer.
. Select the "Filter by name..." text field.
. In properties view, under the attributes panel, find the attribute id. Give the text field the id "filterText". This is what the component will be called in the Java companion file.
. In the outline, hover your mouse above the selected vaadin-text-field. A button will appear on the same row to allow you to connect the component to Java. Click on the icon. The field is now available from Java code.
+
image::connect-text-field-to-java.png[Connect the text field to java using the outline.]
. In the same way, select the button, give it an id called "addContactButton", and click on the connect icon.
. In the same way, select the grid, give it an id called "grid", and click on the connect icon.

You should now have all the fields available from Java code. Let's go check it out.

. Go back to IntelliJ IDEA.
. Open the class `src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.MainView`.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.js")
@Route("")
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    @Id("filterText") <1>
    private TextField filterText; <2>
    @Id("addContactButton")
    private Button addContactButton; <3>
    @Id("grid")
    private Grid grid; <4>

    /**
     * Creates a new MainView.
     */
    public MainView() {
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
    }

    /**
     * This model binds properties between MainView and main-view
     */
    public interface MainViewModel extends TemplateModel {
        // Add setters and getters for template properties here.
    }
}
----
<1> Field are connected to the template id with a `@Id("identifer")` annotation
<2> The text field, with same name as id, and correct Java class
<3> The button
<4> The grid

[#java-data-to-grid]
=== Add data into the grid

Let's start by loading data from the backend and showing them in the grid. First task would be to configure the columns. We want to show contacts, and from each contact first name, last name, email and status.

We take advantage of Spring’s dependency injection to get hold of the back end service, by adding it as a parameter to the constructor. Spring passes it in when MainView is created.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----

public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    @Id("filterText")
    private TextField filterText;
    @Id("addContactButton")
    private Button addContactButton;
    @Id("grid")
    private Grid<Contact> grid; <1>

    private ContactService contactService; <2>

    /**
     * Creates a new MainView.
     */

    public MainView(ContactService contactService) { <3>
        this.contactService = contactService; <4>
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getFirstName).setHeader("First name"); <5>
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getLastName).setHeader("Last name");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getEmail).setHeader("Email");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getStatus).setHeader("Status");
        grid.addColumn(contact -> {  <6>
            Company company = contact.getCompany();
            return company == null ? "-" : company.getName();
        }).setHeader("Company");
        grid.getColumns().forEach(col -> col.setAutoWidth(true)); <7>
        updateList();
    }

    private void updateList() {
        grid.setItems(contactService.findAll()); <8>
    }

    /**
     * This model binds properties between MainView and main-view
     */
    public interface MainViewModel extends TemplateModel {
        // Add setters and getters for template properties here.
    }
}
----
<1> Add bean type as type parameter to the grid
<2> A field for storing the service for future access
<3> Spring passes in the service when the view is created
<4> The passed reference to the service is stored in the field
<5> Columns to grid are added and configured
<6> A custom column is created for fetching the name of the company the contact belongs to.
<7> All columns are configured to be sized based on the content of the columns
<8> Items are fetched from the service and passed to the Grid

Now, <<#layout-finished-run-the-project, run the application>>, or if it was already running, restart it. The Grid shows the contacts from the service.

image::grid-populated-run-the-project.png[Grid configured and populated with items from the service.]

[#java-enable-filtering]
=== Enable filtering

We would like to filter the grid based on first name and last name when the user types in a value in the filter textfield. For that, we need a value change listener to the textfield, and we need to pass the value of the text field to the contact service. The contact service and repository don't support filtering right now, so we need to add that support as well.

Let's start with changing `MainView`.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    // Fields omitted
    ...

    public MainView(ContactService contactService) {
        this.contactService = contactService;
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getFirstName).setHeader("First name");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getLastName).setHeader("Last name");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getEmail).setHeader("Email");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getStatus).setHeader("Status");
        grid.addColumn(contact -> {
            Company company = contact.getCompany();
            return company == null ? "-" : company.getName();
        }).setHeader("Company");
        grid.getColumns().forEach(col -> col.setAutoWidth(true));

        updateList();

        filterText.setValueChangeMode(ValueChangeMode.LAZY); <1>
        filterText.addValueChangeListener(e -> updateList()); <2>
    }

    private void updateList() {
        grid.setItems(contactService.findAll(filterText.getValue())); <3>
    }

    // Template model omitted
    ...
}
----

<1> Put text field value changes into lazy mode, so that we don't query the database on each keystroke
<2> Add value change listener to text field that tells the grid items to be updated
<3> Pass the value of the text field to the service `findAll` method. This will not compile yet as the method does not exist.

The contact service does not have a `findAll` method that takes a filter String as a parameter, so let's add one.

.`*ContactService.java*`
[source,java]
----
public List<Contact> findAll() { <1>
    return contactRepository.findAll();
}

public List<Contact> findAll(String stringFilter) { <2>
    if (stringFilter == null || stringFilter.isEmpty()) {
        return contactRepository.findAll();
    } else {
        return contactRepository.search(stringFilter);
    }
}
----

<1> Existing findAll method that we do not need to touch
<2> New method for filtering based on String

Finally, we need to add the method to search contacts to `ContactRepository`.

.`*ContactRepository.java*`
[source,java]
----
public interface ContactRepository extends JpaRepository<Contact, Long> {
    @Query("select c from Contact c " +
            "where lower(c.firstName) like lower(concat('%', :searchTerm, '%')) " +
            "or lower(c.lastName) like lower(concat('%', :searchTerm, '%'))")
    List<Contact> search(@Param("searchTerm") String searchTerm);
}
----

Run the application. Now the Grid is searchable based on name with the help of the text field.

image::grid-filtered-run-the-project.png[Grid filtered based on text field contents.]

[#java-contact-form]
== Implement the contact form

Now that the work with the grid is complete, let's turn our attention to the contact form.

We want the following behaviour:
. The form is hidden when it is not needed
. The form can be used to edit or delete an existing contact
. The form can be used to add a new contact

Let's start by hiding the form.

[#java-hiding-the-form]
=== Hiding the form

The `MainView` class knows when the form is needed. So, we'll use that to hide and show the form.

First, we'll connect the form to the MainView class, and then call setVisible on the form to hide it.

. Open `main-view` in Designer.
. Select the contact form.
. Give the contact form an id with value "form".
. Click the java connection icon for contact-form in the outline.

The contact form is now accessible from the `MainView` class.

Now, open the `MainView` class and do the following changes to hide the form initially.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    // Previous fields omitted

    @Id("form")
    private ContactForm form; <1>

    public MainView(ContactService contactService) {
      // Previous lines omitted

      closeEditor(); <2>
    }

    private void closeEditor() { <3>
      form.setVisible(false);
    }

    // Rest of the class omitted
}
----

<1> Field created by Designer.
<2> Call closeEditor on the last line of constructor to initially hide the form.
<3> A new method that calls `setVisible` to close the form.

WARNING: Unfortunately, a https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/8256[bug] prevents `setVisible` from working correctly in our case. A workaround is presented below. Without the workaround, the form won't be hidden.

To work around the https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/8256[bug]:
. Open `contact-form.js` in IntelliJ IDEA.
. Edit the source by adding the following CSS rule into the style element.

.`*contact-form.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
    static get template() {
        return html`
<style include="shared-styles">
                :host {
                    display: block;
                    height: 100%;
                }
                /* Workaround for https://github.com/vaadin/flow/issues/8256 */
                :host([hidden]) { <1>
                  display: none !important;
                }
            </style>
`;
    }
----
<1> CSS that will be applied when the hidden attribute is present on the contact-form element.

Now, the contact form will be hidden when the application is started.

image::form-hidden-run-the-project.png[Form hidden when initially starting the application.]

Next, we'll open the form when a contact is selected in the grid, and pass that contact to the form.

[#java-open-form-with-selected]
== Opening the form with selected contact

When the user clicks on a contact in the grid, the contact becomes selected. At that point, we want to open the form and fill the form with the contact's data. Let's start by listening for selection event in the grid, and in the event, passing the contact to the form.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {
    // Omitted

    public MainView(ContactService contactService) {

        // Omitted

        grid.getColumns().forEach(col -> col.setAutoWidth(true));
        grid.asSingleSelect().addValueChangeListener(event ->
                editContact(event.getValue())); <1>

        // Omitted
    }

    private void editContact(Contact contact) { <2>
        if (contact == null) {
            closeEditor();
        } else {
            form.setContact(contact); <3>
            form.setVisible(true);
        }
    }

    // Omitted
}
----

<1> Add listener for selection change in grid.
<2> A new method to show or hide the form depending on whether there's a selection or not.
<3> Pass the contact to the form. This is a new method that needs to be added to ContactForm.

Let's add `setContact` method to `ContactForm`. For now, it is sufficient that the project compiles, so we'll leave the method empty. It will be implemented in the next section.

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class ContactForm extends PolymerTemplate<ContactForm.ContactFormModel> {
    // Omitted

    public void setContact(Contact contact) { <1>
        // to be implemented
    }

    // Omitted
}
----

<1> Add a method to set the contact. This will be implemented shortly.

If you run the application now, you'll see that when you select a contact the form will be opened. And, if you click on the selected contact, it becomes deselected and the form is closed. The form remains empty, though, because we didn't bind its fields to the given contact just yet. 

Next, let's populate the form with the selected contact's details.

[#java-add-binder-to-contact-form]
=== Adding a binder

To make the contact's details visible and editable in the form, we will need to bind the contact bean to the form. This can be done by using a binder object. We'll use a validating binder that gives us simple validation based the member fields of the contact bean.

First, let's add the binder to the `ContactForm` class and use it to bind the given contact's fields to the form.

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
// Other fields omitted
Binder<Contact> binder = new BeanValidationBinder<>(Contact.class); <1>

public ContactForm() {
    binder.bindInstanceFields(this); <2>
}

public void setContact(Contact contact) {
    binder.setBean(contact); <3>
}
----
<1> `BeanValidationBinder` is a `Binder` that is aware of bean validation annotations. By passing it the `Contact.class`, we define the type of object we are binding to.
<2> `bindInstanceFields` matches fields in `Contact` and `ContactForm` based on their names.
<3> Set the given contact to the binder.

The binder will look for fields in the `Contact` class and in `ContactForm` and bind those whose names match.

WARNING: If you run the application now, the binder will throw an exception because it won't find a single field to bind to. We'll add the fields shortly using Designer.

Next, let's add the fields that the binder can bind to.

[#java-connect-contact-form-fields]
== Connecting the fields from contact-form

To make it possible for the binder to bind a contact bean's fields to the form fields, the fields must be present as members in the ContactForm class. We can add the fields to the class using Designer. We'll need to be careful with naming the fields because the binder works by matching the bean and field names. The bean contains fields called: `firstName`, `lastName`, `email`, `company`, and `status`. When we connect the fields from `contact-form`, we need to use these exact names.

. Open `contact-form` in Designer
. Connect the first name field with id "firstName" by selecting the field for first name, giving it the id "firstName" and connecting it using the outline.
. Connect the last name field with id "lastName".
. Connect the email field with id "email".
. Connect the company field with id "company".
. Connect the status field with id "status".

image::form-connect-fields-designer.png[Connect the form fields in Designer.]

When done with Designer, you should have the following fields in the `ContactForm` class:

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
    @Id("firstName")
    private TextField firstName;
    @Id("lastName")
    private TextField lastName;
    @Id("email")
    private EmailField email;
    @Id("company")
    private ComboBox<String> company;
    @Id("status")
    private ComboBox<String> status;
----

Now, this will again raise an exception when run, because the types of the combo boxes do not match the types in the `Contact` bean. Let's fix the types by editing them directly in the Java file:

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
    @Id("company")
    private ComboBox<Company> company;
    @Id("status")
    private ComboBox<Contact.Status> status;
----

There's a couple more things to fix. One is the texts you see in the company combo box. Currently, the contact object is printed as the value of the combo box. Instead of the object, we want to see the name of the company. The other issue is that the items in the combo boxes are yet to be set. We can get the companies from the `CompanyService`, and the statuses from the `Status` enumeration.

Here's the full `ContactForm` class that implements the above changes.

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
public class ContactForm extends PolymerTemplate<ContactForm.ContactFormModel> {

    Binder<Contact> binder = new BeanValidationBinder<>(Contact.class);
    @Id("firstName")
    private TextField firstName;
    @Id("lastName")
    private TextField lastName;
    @Id("email")
    private EmailField email;
    @Id("company")
    private ComboBox<Company> company;
    @Id("status")
    private ComboBox<Contact.Status> status;

    public ContactForm(CompanyService companyService) { <1>
        binder.bindInstanceFields(this);

        company.setItems(companyService.findAll()); <2>
        company.setItemLabelGenerator(Company::getName); <3>
        status.setItems(Contact.Status.values()); <4>
    }

    public void setContact(Contact contact) {
        binder.setBean(contact);
    }

    // TemplateModel omitted
}
----
<1> Add `companyService` as parameter. Spring framework will inject it here.
<2> Set the company combo box items by getting them from the service.
<3> Set item label generator so that we see company names in the combo box instead of company objects.
<4> Set the items of the status combo box.

When the app is run now, there are no exceptions, and all form fields are filled correctly, and items in the combo boxes are populated.

image::form-populated-run-the-project.png[Form populated with the selected contact's details.]

Next, we'll need to make the changes we make in the form to persist.

== Adding, saving and deleting contacts

So far, we've only displayed existing contact data in the application without the ability to add or modify them.

In this section, we'll make adding and modifying contacts work.

First, let's make the Save, Delete and Close buttons work in the contact form. To add functionality to the buttons, we'll first need to make them available in the `ContactForm` class using Designer.

. Open `contact-form` in Designer
. Select the save button. Give it the id "save", and connect using the outline.
. Select the delete button. Give it the id "delete", and connect using the outline.
. Select the close button. Give it the id "close", and connect using the outline.

Now you've added the following fields to `ContactForm`.

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
    @Id("save")
    private Button save;
    @Id("delete")
    private Button delete;
    @Id("close")
    private Button close;
----

When any of the above buttons is pressed, we want to execute the corresponding action. In order to not add a circular dependency between MainView and ContactForm, and to keep ContactForm reusable, we'll make ContactForm to send an event on a button press. `MainView` will capture the events and perform the actual actions.

Vaadin comes with an event-handling system for components. We’ve already used it to listen to value-change events from the filter text field. We want the form component to have a similar way of letting `MainView` know what is happening in the form.

To do this, add the following event definitions at the end of the `ContactForm` class:

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
// Events
public static abstract class ContactFormEvent extends ComponentEvent<ContactForm> {
  private Contact contact;

  protected ContactFormEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) { <1>
    super(source, false);
    this.contact = contact;
  }

  public Contact getContact() {
    return contact;
  }
}

public static class SaveEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  SaveEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) {
    super(source, contact);
  }
}

public static class DeleteEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  DeleteEvent(ContactForm source, Contact contact) {
    super(source, contact);
  }

}

public static class CloseEvent extends ContactFormEvent {
  CloseEvent(ContactForm source) {
    super(source, null);
  }
}

public <T extends ComponentEvent<?>> Registration addListener(Class<T> eventType,
    ComponentEventListener<T> listener) { <2>
  return getEventBus().addListener(eventType, listener);
}
----
<1> `ContactFormEvent` is a common superclass for all the events. It contains the contact that was edited or deleted.
<2> The `addListener` method uses Vaadin’s event bus to register the custom event types. Select the `com.vaadin` import for `Registration` if IntelliJ IDEA asks.

With the above events, we can now implement the click listeners. Add the following to the `ContactForm` class:

.`*ContactForm.java*`
[source,java]
----
    public ContactForm(CompanyService companyService) {
        // Omitted

        save.addClickListener(e -> validateAndSave()); <1>
        delete.addClickListener(e -> fireEvent(new DeleteEvent(this, binder.getBean()))); <2>
        close.addClickListener(e -> fireEvent(new CloseEvent(this))); <3>
        
        binder.addStatusChangeListener(e -> save.setEnabled(binder.isValid())); <4>
    }

    private void validateAndSave() {
        if (binder.isValid()) { <5>
            fireEvent(new SaveEvent(this, binder.getBean()));
        }
    }
----
<1> The save button calls the `validateAndSave` method
<2> The delete button fires a `delete` event and passes the currently-edited contact.
<3> The cancel button fires a `close` event.
<4> Validates the form every time it changes. If it is invalid, it disables the save button to avoid invalid submissions.
<5> Only fires a `save` event if the form is valid.

Now, the events are sent. Next, we'll need to listen to and handle them in `MainView`.

Add the following changes to `MainView` to handle the contact form events, as well as the still missing "add contact" button click:

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
    public MainView(ContactService contactService) {
        // omitted

        form.addListener(ContactForm.SaveEvent.class, this::saveContact); <1>
        form.addListener(ContactForm.DeleteEvent.class, this::deleteContact); <2>
        form.addListener(ContactForm.CloseEvent.class, e -> closeEditor()); <3>

        addContactButton.addClickListener(e -> editContact(new Contact())); <4>
    }

    private void saveContact(ContactForm.SaveEvent event) { <5>
        contactService.save(event.getContact());
        updateList();
        closeEditor();
    }

    private void deleteContact(ContactForm.DeleteEvent event) { <6>
        contactService.delete(event.getContact());
        updateList();
        closeEditor();
    }

    private void closeEditor() {
        form.setVisible(false);
        grid.asSingleSelect().clear(); <7>
    }
----
<1> Call `saveContact` when `save` event received from the contact form.
<2> Call `deleteContact` when `delete` event received from the contact form.
<3> Close the form when close event received from the contact form.
<4> Handle add button click by opening the form with a new `Contact` object.
<5> A new method to save the contact to the service, refresh the grid, and close the form.
<6> A new method to delete the contact to the service, refresh the grid, and close the form.
<7> Clear selection when closing from the form to keep behaviour consistent.
