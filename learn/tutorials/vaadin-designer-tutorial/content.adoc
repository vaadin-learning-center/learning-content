[#set-up-development-environment]
== Setting up a Java development environment

Before you can start developing your Java app, you need to install the necessary tools and set up your development environment. You can follow the tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin/setting-up-a-java-development-environment[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin - Setting up a Java development environment] to get your Java development environment in place.

If you already have a working Java development environment, including a JDK, Maven, Git, Node.js, and an IDE, you can skip this step and proceed to set up a Vaadin project. This tutorial expects that you are using IntelliJ IDEA, but everything is available for Eclipse as well.

[#install-designer]
== Installing Vaadin Designer

Vaadin Designer is a plug-in for your Integrated development environment (IDE). It exists for both IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse. You can follow the instructions below on how to install the plug-in. If you followed the "Setting up a Java development environment" tutorial above, then you have the IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE.

* https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/designer/getting-started/designer-installing-idea.html[Installing Vaadin Designer in IntelliJ IDEA]
* https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/designer/getting-started/designer-installing-eclipse.html[Installing Vaadin Designer in Eclipse]

[#install-chrome]
== Installing Google Chrome

When you open up a design file with Designer, the source code is shown in the IDE, while the visual editor opens up in the Chrome browser. If you do not have Chrome installed, follow https://www.google.com/chrome/[the instructions to install it on your computer].

[#set-up-vaadin-project]
== Set up a Vaadin project

The first step in any development project is to set up a project and get it running. The tutorial https://vaadin.com/learn/tutorials/modern-web-apps-with-spring-boot-and-vaadin[Building Modern Web Apps with Spring Boot and Vaadin], chapters 3-5, shows you how to get a Vaadin project up and running on your computer, ready to be developed further.

Follow chapters 3-5 in the tutorial to get the project that we will continue using with Vaadin Designer.

[#start-building]
== Start building the application

With IntelliJ running and a project available, we can take our first steps towards building our first views with Designer.

. Delete the file MainView.java in src/main/java/com/vaadin/tutorial/crm/ui
. In the Project tree, expand the frontend and src folders
. Right click on the src folder, and select New > Directory. Give the directory name "views" and press ok. 
. Right click on the newly created view folder, select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. In the "Java package" field, press the folder selection button and navigate to com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.
. In the "Name" field, type `main-view`.
. Press ok to generate the files.

Designer opens up in Google Chrome.

[#getting-familiar-with-the-ui]
== Getting familiar with the UI
Designer consists of four main parts: paper, palette, outline and properties.

*Paper* is where the UI you are building is rendered. It shows you what your view will look like. Before you have any components added to your view, the paper will propose a set of starting points for your newly created view.

*Palette* is a list of components that you have available for use. The list is divided in multiple sections:

- HTML elements are the built in elements of the HTML language, like <p>, <h1> and <div>.
- Parts is a list of all the web components available in your project. These are scanned from the node_modules folder in your project automatically. If you add a new 3rd party web component to your project, it will show up in the parts list and be available for use.
- Components are snippets for Vaadin's components that give you handy commonly used configurations, like having a button with an icon and caption. 
- Patterns are preconfigured view parts  

*Outline* shows you what components are in use in the view as well as their hierarchy.

*Properties* is where you modify how a single component will look and behave.

[#create-the-main-layout]
== Creating the main layout

image::app-complete.png[A web application with a listing of contacts and an editor open.]

This is the layout that we are going to build.

We can note that at the root of the view we need vertical layout. At the top is a horizontal layout with for a filtering text field as well as a button to add new entries. Below we have a horizontal layout for a grid of data entries and a form. Let's disregard the form for now, as we will will build it separately, and add the rest of the components to the view.

[#add-the-components]
=== Adding all the components.
. On the paper, click on "Vertical" to get a vertical layout as your starting point. Your view constists now of an empty layout.
. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette. Drag it twice on top of the vaadin-vertical-layout on the paper.
. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  An easy way to find components is to use the search field at the top of the palette. Drag "Vaadin Text Field" on top of the *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout.
. Find "Button" in the palette.  Drag "Button" on top of the *first* vaadin-horizontal-layout.
. Find "vaadin-grid" in the palette. Drag it on top of the *second* vaadin-horizontal-layout.

image::adding-all-the-components.png[Components added to the view.]

Our view is not looking like planned yet, but it has the components we need. Let's continue with configuring the components to look correct.

[#configure-main-layout]
=== Configuring the main layout
For the main layout, we want to add a bit of space between the components as well as around the layout to make it look nicer. 

. Select the top level layout, by clicking on any of the empty space of the vertical layout.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the padding selector and select "M". This will add some space around the main layout, letting the design breath a bit.
. In the same panel, open the spacing selector and select "M". This will add space between the toolbar and the grid.

image::configuring-the-main-layout.png[Spacing and padding added to the main layout.]

[#configure-toolbar]
=== Configuring the toolbar
For the toolbar, we have to configure the texts to be correct. 

. Select the text field.
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the attribute called "label". Remove the value from it. We do not have a separate label as we have the description as the placeholder value for the field.
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the placeholder attribute. Remove the "Placeholder" value and replace it with "Filter by name..."
. In the properties view, under attributes, find the clear-button-visible attribute. Enable the checkbox. This will give the users to clear the filter in the UI.
. Select the button.
. In the properties view, find the text panel at the top. Remove the default text "Button" and replace it with "Add contact".

image::configuring-the-toolbar.png[Toolbar has the correct texts.]

[#space-for-grid]
=== Make the Grid take all the space available
We want to give the Grid the rest of the screen space, to show as much data as possible.

. Select the lower horizontal layout, vaadin-horizontal-layout. 
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, find the width and height fields. Choose "100%" in both of them to expand the layout to take all the space available.
. Select the Grid, vaadin-grid.
. In the properties view, under Size and space panel, put width and height fields to "100%" to give all the space from the layout to the grid.

image::space-for-grid.png[Toolbar has the correct texts.]

Now our main layout looks great, but it is still missing the form.

[#create-form]
== Creating the form
It is good to keep designs focused on one thing and split them up to smaller things if there starts to be too much focus areas in one view. Let's create the form for the view in an own design. In it we want to create a Form Layout for our Contact entity.

[#form-create-design]
=== Create a new Design file.

. Switch back to IntelliJ.
. In the Project window, right click on the frontend/src/views folder. Select New > Vaadin 10+ Design.
. Check the "Create Java companion file" checkbox. This will allow us to bind data and add listners in Java to our view. 
. Verify that the Java package is com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.
. In the "Name" field, type `contact-form`.
. Press ok to generate the files.
. The design opens up in the browser. In the Palette view, Search for "vaadin-form". Drag  vaadin-form-layout on top of the drop section in the canvas.

image::form-create-design.png[New design for the form.]

Our form component will have:

* Text fields for the first and last name.
* An email field.
* Two select fields: one to select the company and the other to select the contact status.

[#form-add-text-fields]
=== Add two text fields for the name

. Find "Vaadin Text Field" in the palette.  Drag "Vaadin Text Field" twice, on top of vaadin-form-layout.
. Select the first vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "First name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.
. Select the second vaadin-text-field in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and replace the text with "Last name". Find the placeholder attribute and remove the value.

[#form-add-email-field]
=== Add the email field

. Find "vaadin-email-field" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and type in "Email".

[#form-add-combo-boxes]
=== Add company and status fields

. Find "vaadin-combo-box" in the palette.  Drag it, twice, on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Select the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Company".
. Select the first vaadin-combo-box in the design. In the properties view, go to the attirubtes panel. Find the label attribute and add the value "Status".

[#form-add-buttons]
=== Add buttons

We want to add buttons for save, delete and close to the form. Save is the primary action and should be highlighted. Delete can be a dangerous action and should be marked as error. Close button is not an important action and can be downlplayed with a tertiary styling.

. Find "Horizontal Layout Spacing" in the palette.  Drag it on top of the vaadin-form-layout.
. Find the Vaadin button -section in the palette.  Under it drag three different buttons on top of the horizontal layout. First a "Primary Button", then a "Primary Error Button" next to it, and finally a "Tertiary Button" next to it.
. Select the Primary button. Replace the text of the button to "Save".
. Select the Primary Error button. Replace the text of the button to "Delete". 
. Under Attributes, change the theme attribute from "primary error" to "error".
. Select the Tertiary button. Replace the text of the button to "Close".

Now our form is done.

image::form-create-design-finished.png[Finished form.]

[#add-form-to-main-view]
== Add the form to the main view

We can go back to our main view and add it next to the Grid. You should have the main-view Design open in a second tab in Chrome. If you do not, reopen the main-view.js file again in IntelliJ.

In the palette, there should now be a secion called Project Components. Under it are listed other designs that you have created. By dragging from here, you can embed other designs into the one that is currently open.

. With main-view Designer open, locate contact-form in Project Components in the palette.
. Drag contact-form on top of the second vaadin-horizontal-layout.

image::add-form-to-main-view.png[Form embedded in main view.]

[#size-grid-and-form]
=== Sizing grid and form

We want to give most of the space to the grid. We will use flex sizing for it, to give a 2:1 ratio between the grid and the form.

. Select vaadin-grid. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Add to the end of the value "flex: 2;".
. Select contact-form. Under properties view, under the Attributes panel, find the style attribute. Set the value to "flex: 1;".

Now our layout is done.

image::size-grid-and-form.png[Form embedded in main view.]

[#add-route-to-main-view]
== Add the route to the main view.

As we replaced the MainView with our own, it doesn't have a route annotation anymore. Let's add back the root route to point towards MainView.

. Switch back to IntelliJ
. Expand the package src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui and open the file MainView.
. Add `@Route("")` annotation to the top MainView class.


.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.js")
@Route("") <1>
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {
    // The rest of the file is omitted from the code snippet
}
----
<1> Route annotation mapping http://localhost:8080/ to MainView

[#layout-finished-run-the-project]
== Run the project

Let's run the project and see how the new layout looks like.

. Build the project build either pressing the green hammer in the top right, or by selecting Build -> Build Project from the menu.
. If you do not have the server running anymore, run the application by pressing the green bug in the top right, or by selecting Run -> Debug 'Application' from the menu.
. Point your browser towards http://localhost:8080/ to see the result.

image::layout-finished-run-the-project.png[The application running in the browser.]

== Connect your view to Java 

Designer uses two 

Next up we will export the components that you needs data or interaction to Java. For that we have to tell Designer which components we want to have available from Java code. For the main view, we need the Grid for showing data, the text field for filtering and the buttton for adding new contacts.

. Open main-view in Designer.
. Select the text field.
. In properties view, under the attributes panel, find the attribute id. Give the text field the id "filterText". This is what the component will be called in the Java companion file.
. In the outline, hover your mouse above the selected vaadin-text-field. A button will appear on the same row to allow you to connect the component to Java. Click on the icon. The field is now available from Java code.
. In the same way, select the button, give it an id called "addContactButton", and click on the connect icon.
. In the same way, select the grid, give it an id called "grid", and click on the connect icon.

You should now have all the fields available from Java code. Let's go check it up.

. Go back to IntelliJ.
. Open up the class src/main/java/com.vaadin.tutorial.crm.ui.MainView.

.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----
@Tag("main-view")
@JsModule("./src/views/main-view.js")
@Route("")
public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    @Id("filterText") <1>
    private TextField filterText; <2>
    @Id("addContactButton")
    private Button addContactButton; <3>
    @Id("grid")
    private Grid grid; <4>

    /**
     * Creates a new MainView.
     */
    public MainView() {
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
    }

    /**
     * This model binds properties between MainView and main-view
     */
    public interface MainViewModel extends TemplateModel {
        // Add setters and getters for template properties here.
    }
}
----
<1> Field are connected to the template id with a @Id("identifer") annotation
<2> The text field, with same name as id, and correct Java class
<3> The button
<4> The grid

=== Add data into the grid

Let's start by loading data from the backend and showing them in the grid. First task would be to configure the columns. We want to show contacts, and from each contact first name, last name, email and status.

We take advantage of Spring’s dependency injection to get hold of the back end service, by adding it as a parameter to the constructor. Spring passes it in when MainView is created.


.`*MainView.java*`
[source,java]
----

public class MainView extends PolymerTemplate<MainView.MainViewModel> {

    @Id("filterText")
    private TextField filterText;
    @Id("addContactButton")
    private Button addContactButton;
    @Id("grid")
    private Grid<Contact> grid;

    private ContactService contactService; <1>
    /**
     * Creates a new MainView.
     */

    public MainView(ContactService contactService) { <2>
        this.contactService = contactService; <3>
        // You can initialise any data required for the connected UI components here.
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getFirstName).setHeader("First name"); <4>
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getLastName).setHeader("Last name");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getEmail).setHeader("Email");
        grid.addColumn(Contact::getStatus).setHeader("Status");
        grid.addColumn(contact -> {  <5>
            Company company = contact.getCompany();
            return company == null ? "-" : company.getName();
        }).setHeader("Company")
        grid.getColumns().forEach(col -> col.setAutoWidth(true)); <6>
        grid.setItems(contactService.findAll()); <7>
    }

    /**
     * This model binds properties between MainView and main-view
     */
    public interface MainViewModel extends TemplateModel {
        // Add setters and getters for template properties here.
    }
}
----
<1> A field for storing the service for future access
<2> Spring passes in the service when the view is created
<3> The passed reference to the service is stored in the field
<4> Columns to grid are added and configured
<5> A custom column is created for fetching the name of the company the contact belongs to.
<6> All columns are configured to be sized based on the content of the columns
<7> Items are fetched from the service and passed to the Grid
