This part of the tutorial shows how to display data in a https://vaadin.com/components/vaadin-grid[Grid component^].

== Adding the Domain Objects

Before getting into actual web development with Vaadin, we need to add the necessary domain objects and a dummy back end.

Copy or download the following three Java classes from GitHub and add them to your project:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/CustomerStatus.java[CustomerStatus.java^]: This is a simple enum type.

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/Customer.java[Customer.java^]: This is the main domain object, a basic Java bean that encapsulates data about a customer.

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/CustomerService.java[CustomerService.java^]: This is a simple service class that you can use to get and save `Customer` instances. Think of this class as the entry point to a dummy database.

[TIP]
A fast way to copy classes in IntelliJ IDEA is to use the clipboard. In the browser, select the content of the file and choose *Edit > Copy*. In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click `org.vaadin.example` in the *Project* view and select *Paste*. IntelliJ IDEA is smart enough to create a properly-named Java file automatically.

[NOTE]
The actual implementation of these classes is not relevant for this tutorial, but feel free to explore them. In a real-world application, you would most likely have something similar, but implemented with JPA, and EJB or Spring-managed beans, for example.

== Showing Data in a Grid

When building UIs for data-centric applications, you frequently start by listing data from a back end. Vaadin offers several https://vaadin.com/components[components] and ways to do this. This tutorial uses the `Grid` component to present data in a table. The data comes from the dummy back end you added in the previous section.

To show the data in a `Grid` component:

. In the `MainView` class, add a reference to the `CustomerService` class and introduce an instance variable of type `Grid` as follows:
+
[source, java]
----
...
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
    private Grid<Customer> grid = new Grid<>(Customer.class);

    public MainView() {
        ...
    }
}
----
+
[TIP]
You can fix the compilation errors shown in red using the [Alt+Enter] (Windows) or [Option+Enter] (Mac) shortcut. Position the cursor right after the error in red (for example `Grid`) and then use the shortcut. Make sure to choose the correct class from the `org.vaadin` package.

. The `Grid` component uses columns and rows to show data. Configure the columns by replacing the constructor of the `MainView` class with :
+
[source,java]
----
...
    public MainView() {
        grid.setColumns("firstName", "lastName", "status");

        add(grid);

        setSizeFull();
    }
...
----
* `setColumns` configures the `Grid` to show the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `status` properties of the `Customer` class.

* `add(grid)` adds the `Grid` to the `VerticalLayout`.

* `setSizeFull` sets the height and width of the `VerticalLayout` to 100% so that it uses all the space available in the browser.
+
TIP: As an alternative, you can use the `addColumn(ValueProvider)` method to add columns in a type-safe manner. For example, to add a column for the `firstName` property, call `grid.addColumn(Customer::getFirstName)`.

. At this point, the `Grid` columns are ready, but there are no rows yet. To add rows, use the `setItems(Customer...)` method. Since later in the tutorial you will need to refresh the rows, it makes sense to create a method for this now. Create a new `updateList()` method and call it from the constructor as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
...
    public MainView() {
        ...

        updateList();
    }

    public void updateList() {
        grid.setItems(service.findAll());
    }
...
----

. Compile the project, by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA, and refresh your browser to see the changes.
