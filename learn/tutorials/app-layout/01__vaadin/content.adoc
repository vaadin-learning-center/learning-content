== Intro
A web application can target a wide variety of audiences.
In our case, I assume a web application that is used to support internal processes in a company.
This is a typical business application, which has probably been seen by just about every developer.
The web interfaces in this area are quite often based on the experiences made with the classic desktop applications.

== Minimal Requirements
In our minimal version, we will assume that there will be a menu in the application header.
The number of menu entries is limited to four to five and is, therefore, no challenge for a screen.
Of course, on the assumption that the terms used are a little shorter than some German words, such as "Gleisschotterrbettungsreinigungsmaschine."

[NOTE]
====
An online demo is deployed on  https://flow-layout-app-layout-vaadin.herokuapp.com/[Heroku]
or try it on your machine inside Docker:

[source, bash]
----
docker pull vaadintutorials/flow-layout-app_layout-vaadin
docker run -p8899:8899 --name demo vaadintutorials/flow-layout-app_layout-vaadin

== The Layout
The web application layout is a frame that contains the menu header and a slot for views. 
Here we have the challenge for the first time that the navigation should not replace the contents of the entire window, only the area where the views are shown.
The following image illustrates the structure.

The views are shown in the area marked "Products."

== The basic structure
The basic framework that will be used here is based on the link:/components/vaadin-app-layout[ App Layout] component by Vaadin.
The App Layout handles routing using RouterLayout.

To start with Vaadin's AppLayout, we'll create a class named
**MainLayout**, extending the class **AppLayout**.


[NOTE]
====
If you are using the following dependency, the component app-layout is already available in your classpath.
[source, xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
      <artifactId>vaadin</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

If not, the corresponding **maven** dependency is

[source,java]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vaadin</groupId>
    <artifactId>vaadin-app-layout-flow</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
====

The app-layout will be customized inside the constructor or the class **MainLayout**.
For this you have to use the methods **addToDrawer**, **setContent** and **addToNavbar**.

=== setContent
With this method, the actual content of the working area is set. Here in this example
is is used only once after the user had passed the login process.
[source, java]
----
setContent(new Span("click in the menu ;-) , you will see me never again.."));
----

=== addToNavbar
This method is used to set the navigation bar and the Icon that will be shown in the upper left corner.
First, the Icon itself is loaded, and the height is fixed to **44px**.
The instance of the class **DrawerToggle** is used to make the navigation bar responsive.
Technically it is a specialised button with the provided Icon that is used to open and close the navigation bar itself.

[source, java]
----
    StreamResource res = new StreamResource(LOGO_PNG ,
                                            () -> MainView.class.getResourceAsStream("/" + LOGO_PNG));
    Image img = new Image(res , "Vaadin Logo");
    img.setHeight("44px");
    addToNavbar(new DrawerToggle(), img);

----

=== addToDrawer
The method **addToDrawer** is responsible for setting the main menu itself. The menubar is implemented with
Tabs. Every tab is one visible menu entry of the navigation bar at the left side.
We need to define a connection between an entry in the menu bar and a component for the content area.
For this, a map is used to hold both references.
The key inside the map is the tab itself, and the value in the map is the component for the content area.

**private Map<Tab, Component> tab2Workspace = new HashMap<>();**

[source, java]
----
  private Tab dashBoard() {
    final Span label = new Span(getTranslation(ITM_DASHBOARD));
    final Icon icon  = DASHBOARD.create();
    final Tab  tab   = new Tab(new HorizontalLayout(icon,label));
    tab2Workspace.put(tab, new DashboardView());
    return tab;
  }
----

[source, java]
----
    final Tabs tabs = new Tabs(dashBoard(), user(), trends(), logout());
    tabs.setOrientation(Tabs.Orientation.VERTICAL);
    tabs.addSelectedChangeListener(event -> {
      final Tab selectedTab = event.getSelectedTab();
      final Component component = tab2Workspace.get(selectedTab);
      setContent(component);
    });
    addToDrawer(tabs);
----

[NOTE]
====
This example is using the **I18Provider** from Flow.
To read more about this, I recommend our tutorials about link:/learn/tutorials/i18n[Internationalizing in Flow]
====

To use the layout now, you have to assign the attribute **layout** with the class **MainLayout** to the participating views in the **@Route** annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Route(value = MainView.NAV_MAIN_VIEW, layout = MainLayout.class)
public class MainView extends Composite<Div> implements HasLogger {
  public static final String NAV_MAIN_VIEW = "main";

  public MainView() {
    getContent().add(new Span("Page content"));
  }
}
----

== Summary
We now have a straightforward framework of an application with a structure typical of today.
The functionalities are limited, but sometimes that is quite enough.
However, if you want a little more extensive options, you can take a look around in the link:/directory[Vaadin Directory] for alternatives or use the more fully-featured link:/start/latest/business-app[Business App starter].

I will take a closer look at a few other ones of them in the next parts of this series.
