This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Java web application to Microsoft’s Azure cloud. Azure offers a 30-day free trial that includes 12 months of free commercial services. You can find details of their free and commercial services on the link:https://azure.microsoft.com/[Azure website].

NOTE: You need a credit card to confirm your identity when signing up on Microsoft Azure. 

We use the latest link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Vaadin Spring Boot starter app] in our example. You can see the example app running on the Azure cloud link:https://azuretest-1590393278273.azurewebsites.net/[here].

The tutorial includes two options to deploy the application:

. Directly from your command line. 
. From a GitHub repository in a CI pipeline.

*Prerequisites:*

. Create an Azure account at link:signup.azure.com[].
. Verify that you have Java installed by running the `java --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
. Verify that you have Git installed by running the `git --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
. Verify that you have Maven (at least version 3.0) installed by running the `mvn -v` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://maven.apache.org/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.

== Option 1: Direct upload from your command line

This method describes how to upload a built JAR file (`.jar`) directly on Microsoft Azure. Skip to *Option 2* below, if you prefer to deploy from a GitHub repository for continuous iteration.

=== Create an Azure application

. Go to the Azure portal https://portal.azure.com/#home and log in.
. Select *Create a resource* under *Azure Services*.
+
image::azure-services.png[Azure Services view]
+
. Go to *Web > Web App*
. In the *Basics* tab, fill in the details:
.. *Subscription: Free Trial*.
.. *Resource Group:* Select *Create new*, enter a group name and select *OK*.
.. *Name:*  The name of your application.
.. *Publish: Code*.
.. *Runtime stack: Tomcat 9.0.*
.. *Operating System: Linux*.
.. *Region:* your region.
.. *Linux Plan: Create New* and enter a name.
.. *Sku and size: Free F1* for 1 GB size.
+

+
. Select *Review + create*.
. Review the details and select *Create*.

TIP: You can also add monitoring options and tags before creating your app, if you like.

=== Prepare the application

. Install the Azure CLI.
+
NOTE: You can find installation instructions for different platforms in the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest[Azure CLI documentation].
+
. Log in to your Azure dashboard by running the `az login` command in your terminal.
. Download and open a starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the technology stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at the defaults).
+
image::vaadin-starter-download.png[Vaadin starter download page]
+
. Change the server port in your Spring project `application.properties` file in src/main/resources to: `server.port=${port:8080}`. You can find more details about this in the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring documentation].
. Open your `pom.xml` file and add the following section in the `<plugins>` tag in the `<build>` section:
+
.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
 <groupId>com.microsoft.azure</groupId>
 <artifactId>azure-webapp-maven-plugin</artifactId>
 <version>1.9.1</version>
</plugin>
----
+
. Configure the application using the `mvn azure-webapp:config command`.  Select the corresponding number to insert your OS: `Linux` and Java version: `Java 11` and then enter *Y* on your keyboard to confirm.
. Run the `mvn azure-webapp:config command` again and press *1* on your keyboard to enter the details of your Azure Web app:
+
.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
    <resourceGroup>YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP</resourceGroup>
       <appName>YOUR_APP_NAME</appName>
       <region>YOUR_REGION</region>
       <pricingTier>F1</pricingTier>
----
+
. Add this `<appSettings>` section to the `<configuration>` section in your `pom.xml`:
+
.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<appSettings>
          <property>
                <name>JAVA_OPTS</name>
                <value>-Dserver.port=80</value>
          </property>
       </appSettings>
----

=== Deploy your application

. Generate a JAR file (`.jar`) of your application using the `mvn package -Pproduction` command.
. Deploy to Azure using the `mvn azure-webapp:deploy` command.
. In the Azure portal go to *Home > App Services* and select your application in the list to configure it.
+
image::azure-services.png[Azure Services view]
+
. Open the application URL in your browser.

=== Prepare the application

. Download and open a starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the technology stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at the defaults).
+
image::vaadin-starter-download.png[Vaadin starter download page]
+
. Change the server port in your Spring project `application.properties` file in src/main/resources to: `server.port=${port:8080}`. You can find more details about this in the link::https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring documentation].
. Generate a JAR file (`.jar`) of your application using the `mvn package -Pproduction` command.
. Create a `web.config` file with the following content. Replace “YOUR_APP_NAME” with the name of your application:
+
.`*web.config*`
[source,config]
----

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
   <system.webServer>
       <handlers>
           <add name="httpPlatformHandler" path="*" verb="*" modules="httpPlatformHandler" resourceType="Unspecified"/>
       </handlers>
       <httpPlatform processPath="%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe"
                     arguments="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Dserver.port=%HTTP_PLATFORM_PORT% -jar%HOME%\site\wwwroot\YOUR_APP_NAME.jar>
       </httpPlatform>
   </system.webServer>
</configuration>
----
+
. Push the `.jar` and `web.config` file to a GitHub repository.
+
TIP: You can create a separate 'deployment' branch containing only the deployment files if your application is already hosted on a GitHub repository.


=== Configure GitHub and deploy your application

. Go to the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com/#home.
. Select the application you just created in Recent resources.
. In the left navigation, select Deployment > Deployment Center.
. In Continuous Deployment (CI / CD) select GitHub. and then Continue.
+
WARNING: You need to authorize GitHub if you haven’t already done so.
+
. Select Continue.
. Select App Service as the build service.
. Select your organization, repository, branch and then continue. This will automatically configure your app for deployment.
. Go to Home > App Services and select your application in the list. 
. Open the application URL in your browser.
