This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Java web application to Google Cloud. Google Cloud offers a 12-month free trial that includes $300 of credits to spend and an unlimited ‘Always Free’ tier. You can find details of their free and commercial services on their link:https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier[documentation page].

NOTE: You need a credit card to confirm your identity when signing up on Google Cloud. 

We use the latest Vaadin link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Spring Boot starter app] in our example. You can see the example app running on Google Cloud link:https://vaadin-demo-test.ew.r.appspot.com/[here].

The tutorial includes two options to deploy the application: 

. As a JAR file directly from your command line. 

. As a Docker container from a GitHub repository using Google’s Kubernetes Engine.

== Prerequisites:

* Create a Google Cloud account at https://cloud.google.com/.
* Verify that you have Java installed by running the `java --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
* Verify that you have Git installed by running the `git --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
* Verify that you have Maven (at least version 3.0) installed by running the `mvn -v` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://maven.apache.org/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.

== Option 1: From Command Line

=== Set up Google Cloud

. Sign into your Google Cloud account: https://console.cloud.google.com/.

. Install Google SDK. You can find detailed instructions on how to install on different platforms on the lnk:https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs[SDK documentation page].

. Create a new project at https://console.cloud.google.com/ and provide a name for it:
+
image::new-project-dashboard.png[New project in dashboard.]
+
. Go to *COMPUTE > App Engine > Dashboard* in the navigation menu on the left:
+
image::app-engine-menu.png[Compute APP ENGINE.]
+
. Click *Create Application*.
+
image::app-engine-create.png[Create APP ENGINE application.]
+
. Choose your region and then select *Create app*.
+
TIP: You can learn more about choosing a region in the link:https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones#choosing_a_region_and_zone[Google Cloud documentation].
+
image::region-select-menu.png[Choose region.]
+
. Select:
* *Language: Java*
* *Environment: Flexible* 

=== Prepare the application

. Download and open a starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the technology stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at the defaults).
. Change the server port in your Spring project `application.properties` file in src/main/resources to: `server.port=${port:8080}`. You can find more details about this in the link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring documentation]
. Generate a *JAR* file (``.jar`) of your application using the `mvn package -Pproduction` command.

=== Configure Google SDK

Initialize Google SDK with the gcloud init command as follows:

----
Welcome! This command will take you through the configuration of gcloud.

Settings from your current configuration [default] are:
compute:
  region: europe-west4
  zone: europe-west4-a
core:
  account: youremail@yourcompany.com
  disable_usage_reporting: 'False'
  project: vaadin-demo-test

Pick configuration to use:
 [1] Re-initialize this configuration [default] with new settings 
 [2] Create a new configuration
Please enter your numeric choice: 
----
If the current configuration is correct, press 1 to continue.
To create a new configuration, press 2. We create a new configuration to show the steps:

* Enter a name

* Choose your account or login with a new account:
----
Choose the account you would like to use to perform operations for 
this configuration:
 [1] youremail@yourcompany.com
 [2] Log in with a new account
Please enter your numeric choice:  1
----
* Select 1. to use your current account and project. 
----
You are logged in as: [youremail@yourcompany.com].

Pick cloud project to use: 
 [1] project name 1
 [2] project name 2
 [3] project name 3
Please enter numeric choice or text value (must exactly match list 
item):  1
----
* Select the number corresponding to the project you created previously. 
----
Your Google Cloud SDK is configured and ready to use!
----
* SDK is now configured for deployment.

=== Deploy your application

. Navigate to the folder containing the generated *JAR* (``.jar`) file (usually  `/target`) and open a new terminal.

. Use the `gcloud app deploy YOUR_APP_NAME.jar` command to deploy the application. 
+
NOTE: Replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name of your generated JAR file
+
. Verify the details and confirm by entering Y.
