This tutorial shows you how to deploy a Java web application to Oracle Cloud. Oracle offers a 30-day free trial that includes $300 to spend on commercial services. You can find details of their free and commercial services on the link:https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/freetier.htm[Oracle website].

NOTE: You need a credit card to confirm your identity when signing up on Oracle Cloud. 

We use the latest link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Vaadin Plain Java starter app] in our example. 
The tutorial includes two options to deploy the application: 
. Using the Oracle WebLogic console.
. From a GitHub repository in a CI pipeline.

*Prerequisites:*

. Create an Oracle Cloud account at https://www.oracle.com/cloud/.
. Verify that you have Java installed by running the `java --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
. Verify that you have Git installed by running the `git --version` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
. Verify that you have Maven (at least version 3.0) installed by running the `mvn -v` command in your terminal. If not, link:https://maven.apache.org/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.

There are many ways to deploy web apps to Oracle Cloud. This tutorial shows how to deploy the latest Vaadin starter application as a WAR (`.war`) file through the link:https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E13222_01/wls/docs90/intro/console.html[Oracle WebLogic Console] with the link:https://www.oracle.com/application-development/cloud-services/developer-service/[Visual builder Studio] as a build job from GitHub. See the link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/java-cloud/tutorials.html[Oracle Tutorial page] for more deployment options.
