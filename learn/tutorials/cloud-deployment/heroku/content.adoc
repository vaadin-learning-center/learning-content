This tutorial shows how to deploy a Java web application to the Heroku cloud. Heroku provides free cloud deployment for up to 5 applications. However, due to their automatic dyno restarts, this platform is best suited to quick demo uploads, rather than full production deployments. You can find more information about this on their https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#automatic-dyno-restarts[website].

We use the latest https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Spring Boot starter app] in our example. You can see the example app running on the Heroku cloud https://starter-vaadin.herokuapp.com/[here]. 

You can deploy the application directly from your command line or from a GitHub repository.

*PREREQUISITES:*

* Create a Heroku account at https://www.heroku.com/home.
* Verify that you have Java installed by running the `java --version` command in your terminal. If not, https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/[download] and install the latest version on your computer.
* Verify that you have Git installed by running the `git --version` command in your terminal. If not, https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[download] and install the latest version on your computer.

== Deploying from the command line

=== Generating a JAR

A JAR (Java Archive) is a package file that merges Java class files and associated metadata and resources, such as text and images, into one distributable file. This is the default file format for your Vaadin app if you created it on https://vaadin.com/start. 

To upload the `.jar` to the Heroku cloud:

. Install the https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install[Heroku CLI] and login to your Heroku dashboard.
. Install the Java CLI plugin by running the `heroku plugins:install java` command in your terminal.
. Download and open the starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the technology stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at the defaults).
+

+
. Change the `server.port` in your Spring project `application.properties` file residing in `src/main/resources` to: `server.port=${port:8080}`. You can find more details about this in the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring documentation].
. Generate a `.jar` from your application using the `mvn package -Pproduction` maven goal. 
. Navigate to the folder containing the generated `.jar` (usually  `/target`).

=== Creating and deploying a Heroku application

You can create and deploy a Heroku application in your Heroku dashboard or using the Java CLI plugin.

NOTE: Replace all instances of `APP_NAME` with the real name of your application.

==== To create and deploy an application in your Heroku dashboard:

. Go to your Heroku dashboard (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and create a new app by selecting *New* > *Create new app*.
+
image::new-app-heroku.png[Create new app]
+
. Name your Heroku application and choose a region. Then click on *Create app*.
+
image::app-name-and-region.png[App name and region]
+
. Deploy the JAR file using the `heroku deploy:jar my-app.jar --app APP_NAME` command. Replace `my-app.jar` with your actual filename.
. Check the URL of the deployed app under *Domains*: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME/settings. The application should be running there.
+
image::domain-name.png[Application URL]

==== To create and deploy an application using the Java CLI plugin:

. Run the ‘heroku create APP_NAME` command.
. Deploy the JAR file using the `heroku deploy:jar my-app.jar --app APP_NAME` command. Replace `my-app.jar` with your actual filename.
. Open the app using the `heroku open --app APP_NAME` command. 

TIP: You can open the application log by running the `heroku logs --tail --app APP_NAME` command in your terminal to troubleshoot any possible errors.


TIP: If your application is packaged as a WAR, deploy your app using the `heroku war:deploy myapp.war --app APP_NAME` command instead. You can find detailed instructions about this in the https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/configuring-war-deployment-with-the-heroku-toolbelt[Heroku documentation].

== Setting up a GitHub CI pipeline

You can deploy an application directly from a GitHub repository instead of uploading it as a JAR. However, this approach does require some tweaking of your project.

=== Configuring the project for GitHub

. Start by creating a `heroku-settings.xml` file and add the following content. This is used to instruct Maven which profiles to enable by default. 
+
.`*heroku-settings.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

    <!-- activate by setting the MAVEN_SETTINGS_PATH config var to heroku-settings.xml in Heroku project settings tab.
    See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-a-custom-maven-settings-xml for more details.
     -->

    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>production</activeProfile>
        <activeProfile>npm</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
</settings>
----
+
. Add the following section to the `<profiles>` section of your`pom.xml`. There are two relevant profiles: `npm` and `production`. `production` is included automatically in the project by default, but `npm` must be configured manually:
+
.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
            <id>npm</id>
            <build>
                <plugins>
                 <plugin>
                    <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
                    <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <!-- Use the latest released version:
                    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/ -->
                    <version>1.9.1</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <id>install node and npm</id>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <!-- optional: default phase is "generate-resources" -->
                            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                    <configuration>
                        <nodeVersion>v12.13.0</nodeVersion>
                    </configuration>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
----
+
. Create a new file `Procfile` (without a file extension) in the root directory of your application and add the following content. This file tells Heroku what to run on startup. 
+
`web: java -jar target/PROJECT_NAME-PROJECT_VERSION.jar $PORT`
+
* Substitute your project name and details for the JAR name. In our case it is `starter_app-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
* This file must reside in the same folder as your `pom.xml`.

. Push the code to your Github repository.

=== Deploying from GitHub

. In your Heroku dashboard (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps), create a new app by selecting *New* > *Create new app*.
+
image::new-app-heroku.png[Create new app]
+
. Name your Heroku application and choose a region. Then click on *Create app*.
+
image::app-name-and-region.png[App name and region]
+
. Connect to the GitHub repository to which you uploaded your application. 
+
image::connect-github-repo.png[Connect to GitHub]
+
. Set the `MAVEN_SETTINGS_PATH` configuration variable to `heroku-settings.xml` in the Heroku project settings tab.
+
image::maven-settings-path.png[Project settings tab]
+
. Check the URL of the deployed app under *Domains*: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME/settings. The application should be running there.
+
