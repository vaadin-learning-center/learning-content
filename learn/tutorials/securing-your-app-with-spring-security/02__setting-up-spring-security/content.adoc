[NOTE]
The tutorial was restructured to emphasize the need of a secured router navigation. The content itself did not change much but we added some more explanation here and there.

After discussing the goals and setting up the project base, we can finally start with the actual work! And that is about **understanding the base problem of Vaadin and Spring Security**.

We all know that Vaadin applications are single-page-applications (SPAs). That means after the first load navigating through the application is done by partial page updates via AJAX requests. 
On the contrary Spring Security's protection mechanism is based on filter chains that works on request level, only. That means it is not able to interpret Vaadin's AJAX requests.
Keeping both aspects in mind it means that plain Spring Security is not enough to protect our Vaadin applications. Instead **we have to make sure to protect the internal router navigation on our own**.
This of course comes with link:#_appendix[some double] bookkeeping as we have to configure protected pages for Spring Security and for the router navigation guard.

== Enable Spring Security
But first, we have to enable Spring Security and add the needed dependencies to our POM:

.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-web</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-config</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Second, we have to disable Spring's MVC error handler. Since Vaadin 14 it causes strange reload behavior. Check this link:https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/17784869/vaadin-14-with-spring-security-login-page-not-loading[forum thread] for details. Thank you all, for fighting this bug down!

.`*Application.java*`
[source,java,linenums]
----
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration.class)
public class Application {
----

Third, is about securing the router navigation. This is *very important as Spring Security is not aware of the single page application behavior* of a Vaadin application. Therefor, we have to register a before navigation listener that checks for permissions.

.`*ConfigureUIServiceInitListener.java*`
[source,java,linenums]
----
@Component // <1>
public class ConfigureUIServiceInitListener implements VaadinServiceInitListener { // <1>

    @Override
    public void serviceInit(ServiceInitEvent event) {
        event.getSource().addUIInitListener(uiEvent -> {
        final UI ui = uiEvent.getUI();
        ui.addBeforeEnterListener(this::beforeEnter); // <2>
        });
    }

    /**
     * Reroutes the user if they are not authorized to access the view.
     *
     * @param event
     *            before navigation event with event details
     */
    private void beforeEnter(BeforeEnterEvent event) {
        if (!LoginView.class.equals(event.getNavigationTarget()) // <3>
            && !SecurityUtils.isUserLoggedIn()) { // <4>
            event.rerouteTo(LoginView.class); // <5>
        }
    }
}
----

<1> Allows adding the navigation listener globally to all UI instances by using a service init listener. Spring takes care of registering it.
<2> Adds the before enter listener.
<3> Ignores the login view itself.
<4> Only redirects if user is not logged in. See below.
<5> Actual rerouting the login view if needed.

.`*SecurityUtils.java*`
[source,java,linenums]
----
static boolean isUserLoggedIn() {
    Authentication authentication = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication(); // <1>
    return authentication != null // <2>
            && !(authentication instanceof AnonymousAuthenticationToken) // <3>
            && authentication.isAuthenticated(); // <4>
}
----
<1> Gets the authentication token from the security context.
<2> Fail if no authentication is available.
<3> Fail for anonymous authentication tokens. Spring Security will add this type of token if all other authentication mechanism failed by default.
<4> Fail if the authentication token is available but is not authenticated.


Fourth, we will add a Vaadin aware Spring Security configuration via the `SecurityConfiguration` class that uses some helpers you can check in the sources.

.`*SecurityConfiguration.java*`
[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * Require login to access internal pages and configure login form.
 */
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // Not using Spring CSRF here to be able to use plain HTML for the login page
    http.csrf().disable() // <1>

            // Register our CustomRequestCache that saves unauthorized access attempts, so
            // the user is redirected after login.
            .requestCache().requestCache(new CustomRequestCache()) // <2>

            // Restrict access to our application.
            .and().authorizeRequests()

            // Allow all flow internal requests.
            .requestMatchers(SecurityUtils::isFrameworkInternalRequest).permitAll() // <3>

            // Allow all requests by logged in users.
            .anyRequest().authenticated() // <4>

            // Configure the login page.
            .and().formLogin().loginPage(LOGIN_URL).permitAll() // <5>
            .loginProcessingUrl(LOGIN_PROCESSING_URL) // <6>
            .failureUrl(LOGIN_FAILURE_URL)

            // Configure logout
            .and().logout().logoutSuccessUrl(LOGOUT_SUCCESS_URL);
}
----
<1> Vaadin has built-in Cross-Site Request Forgery already.
<2> We add a customized request cache to filter out framework internal request. Check `CustomRequestCache` implementation for details.
<3> Permits a set of Vaadin related request types (check `SecurityUtils` for details).
<4> Force authentication for all views.
<5> Configure the URL to the login page for redirects and permit access to everyone.
<6> Configure the login URL Spring Security is expecting POST requests to (form submit).

Finally, we have to make sure that resources Vaadin needs are bypassed and not affected by our security configuration above:

.`*SecurityConfiguration.java*`
[source,java,linenums]
----
/**
 * Allows access to static resources, bypassing Spring security.
 */
@Override
public void configure(WebSecurity web) throws Exception {
    web.ignoring().antMatchers(
            // Vaadin Flow static resources // <1>
            "/VAADIN/**",

            // the standard favicon URI
            "/favicon.ico",

            // the robots exclusion standard
            "/robots.txt",

            // web application manifest // <2>
            "/manifest.webmanifest",
            "/sw.js",
            "/offline-page.html",

            // (development mode) static resources // <3>
            "/frontend/**",

            // (development mode) webjars // <3>
            "/webjars/**",

            // (production mode) static resources // <4>
            "/frontend-es5/**", "/frontend-es6/**");
}
----
<1> Mandatory.
<2> Needed only when developing a Progressive Web Application.
<3> Allows access to frontend resources in development mode.
<4> Grants access to all bundled resources. This is important for your login view (if a Polymer template needs to be accessed) or for every other public page.

Once again, run `mvn spring-boot:run` to build and start the web application and notice the redirection to /login. So far, so good. Now, we have a fully protected web application and can take care of the login view, now.

== Appendix
One last note about the duplicated configuration. There are two possible ways to avoid it: First is about making the Spring Vaadin plugin aware of Spring Security. In this case you would only configure Spring Security as usual and a common router navigation guard would take care of everything else.
In the opposite, the second way is about relying on the router navigation guard only by permitting all requests via the Spring Security configuration. Only the guard would take care of the protection. But this comes with the major drawback that you will not be able to use common Spring Security features and plugins without additional adjustments.
