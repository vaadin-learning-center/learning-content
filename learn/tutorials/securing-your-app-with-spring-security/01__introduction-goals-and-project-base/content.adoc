We get many questions in the forum about *how to use Vaadin 10+ with Spring Security*. We heard you, and we will help you. However, let's start with the definition of "use," first:

Since Vaadin 10, Vaadin supports *client-side templates* in addition to the *Java-only approach*. That means we have to discuss two different types of client-side implementations. We can use as much Spring Security as possible by submitting a form to the configured endpoint or a little less by hooking into Spring Security's authentication flow. Both have pros and cons we will elaborate.

After that, we will take a look at *how to secure the router navigation* and how to work with roles for more fine-grained security. Last but not least, we will introduce the addon *ILAY* that simplifies our task in securing the app and that allows us to not only enable entire views, but also components depending on the logged in user.

In sum we end up with:

. Configuring Spring Security
. Setting up a form-based login view (Java and Polymer based)
. Hooking into the authentication flow and avoid reloading (WIP)
. Secure routing (WIP)
. Finer grained security with roles on view and component level (WIP)
. ILAY (WIP)

*Basic knowledge of Vaadin 14+, Spring Security, and Spring Boot is required for this tutorial*. We will _not_ discuss styling, production builds or other topics unrelated to security.

== Get the base Vaadin + Spring starter
We are using https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base-spring as our starting point. When we started writing the tutorial the starter was using Vaadin 12.0.4 with Spring Boot 2.1.0.RELEASE but nowadays it is Vaadin 14.1.4 with Spring Boot 2.2.0.RELEASE.

```
The project setup is very minimalistic: a single Maven module, no styles, no Polymer templates (prepared folder structure), the typical SpringBoot `Application` class and a main view. Because this starter showcases Spring, it includes a message bean that is injected and used in the `MainView`. It is not relevant for this tutorial.

Now, run `mvn spring-boot:run` to build and start the web application.

Congrats!
