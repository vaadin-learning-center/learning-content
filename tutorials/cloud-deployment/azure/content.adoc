The aim of this tutorial is to show how to deploy a https://vaadin.com/start/latest/simple-ui[Vaadin application] to Azure Cloud. It is not an in-depth tutorial, but rather showing the minimum required steps to get things running and try Azure cloud as a potential host platform for your Vaadin applications.

To get started, https://signup.azure.com[sign up] for a free Microsoft Azure account then open https://portal.azure.com[the portal].

With Microsoft Azure, you can run your application on either a Windows or Linux OS. In this tutorial, we will be using Linux. To start, from the left menu click on *Create a resource*, select *Web*, then select *Web App*.

Fill the new application details and make sure to select *Tomcat 9.0 (JRE 8)* as a runtime.

When the new application is ready, open the new resource to start deploying our Vaadin application in it.

There is a direct way, using FTP access, but in this tutorial we will be using a little bit more elegant way, which is connecting with a Git repository.

First of all, we need to create a new "build" repository for our Vaadin project, that has a simple structre as following: `<respositroy-name>/webapps/project-file.war`. Here is https://github.com/amahdy/vaadin-demo-deployed[an example git repo] with the needed structure.

We can use a local git repository that Azure will configure automatically for us, to do that, select *Deployment Center* from the left menu, then select *Local Git*.

In the next screen, select *Kudu build server* for the build system. This is a very powerful and generic build system that will automatically update and restart the server whenever there is a change on the Git repository.

When everything is ready, you should get a summary similar to this and you confirm by clicking *Finish*.

After the repository is ready, you can manually synchronize your builds with it in the specific structure described above. Credentials for the new Git repository can be managed from the main deployment center page.

As explained earlier, FTP can be used to achieve the same results, but also some exisiting services can make the process easier such as Azure Repos, Github, and Bitbucket. In the next few screens I will show you easy to connect to your exisiting Github repo.

From the *Deployment Center*, this time select *Github* instead of *Local Git*.

image::git-select.png[Select Github]

In the next step select *Kudu build server* as well, and then you will be asked to select the Github repository to synchronize.

And again you will get a confirmation summary.

After each push to the repository, Azure with synchronize it. But you can force synchronize the repository especially after linking it for the first time.

A successful synchronization will trigger a server restart, otherwise you can also force restart the server to see updates.

The provided URL will preview the applications running on the server, but since we are using Tomcat, you may need to https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html[change the configurations] for the *ROOT* app. For now, appending the name of the war file to the URL will help us preview the final deployment.
