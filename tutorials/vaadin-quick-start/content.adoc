In this 2 minute tutorial, you will learn how to build a small but fully functional Vaadin application. This simple example will teach you the basics of component-based development and listening to events.

The application you will build is the classic Todo application.

== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have the following set up on your computer: 

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html[Java 8 or later]
- https://nodejs.org/[Node 10]
- An IDE like IntelliJ, Eclipse, or Netbeans
- Maven

== Download and import the app starter

https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base[Download starter^, role="button button--bordered"]

Once you have the starter downloaded, unzip the file and open it in your IDE.  Ensure you can start the project by running the `spring-boot:run` Maven target. 

You can find detailed instructions for link:/tutorials/import-maven-project-intellij-idea[IntelliJ], link:/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse[Eclipse], and link:/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans[Netbeans] if you need help with importing or running the app.

== Prepare the project
The starter contains some features and code that we don't need in this tutorial. Let's start from a clean slate by removing everything we don't need:
[source,diff]
----

-@PWA(name = "Project Base for Vaadin Flow with Spring", shortName = "Project Base")

public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

- public MainView(@Autowired MessageBean bean) {
+ public MainView() {
-   Button button = new Button("Click me",
-       event -> Notification.show("Clicked!"));
-   add(button);
 }
}

----

We are now ready to start building the app. 

== Building UIs with components and layouts
Vaadin is a component-based framework. You construct user interfaces by instantiating components and putting them into layouts that determine how they get shown. 

`MainLayout.java` extends `VerticalLayout`. This means that each component that is added gets placed underneath the previous one. Vaadin adds padding around the layout and components 
for visual clarity.

Begin by creating all the components we need for the app:

.`*MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----

@Route("")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

 public MainView() {
   VerticalLayout todosList = new VerticalLayout(); // <1>
   TextField taskField = new TextField(); // <2>
   Button addButton = new Button("Add"); // <3>
 }
}

---- 
<1> `todosList` is a vertical layout that will display the task and checkboxes
<2> `taskField` is the text input field for new tasks
<3> `addButton` will trigger logic to add new items to our list of todo items

If you still have your server running, you can build the project and Spring Boot DevTools should pick up the changes. If not, run the `spring-boot:run` Maven target according to the instructions in the "Download and import the app starter" section. 

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080, rel="nofollow"]` and you should see the following:

== Listen to button click events to add new todo items
We now have the main structure of the application in place. But the application doesn't do anything. We need to attach some functionality to the button to turn it into an actual, working application. 

Vaadin uses an _event-driven programming model_. This means that you can listen for events on components to get notified of interactions you are interested in. In our case, we want to listen for the `click` event on the Add-button and attach logic for adding a new todo item to the list.

.`*MainLayout.java*`
[source,java]
----

@Route("")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {


 public MainView() {
   // Component definitions omitted

  addButton.addClickShortcut(Key.ENTER); 
  addButton.addClickListener(click -> {
     // <1>
     Checkbox checkbox = new Checkbox(taskField.getValue());
     todosLayout.add(checkbox);
   }
  );


  add( 
     new H1("Vaadin Todo"),
     todosList,
     new HorizontalLayout(
         taskField,
         addButton
     ),
     stats
  );
 }
}

---- 
<1> Create a checkbox with the value from the `taskField` as it's label.

Refresh your browser, and try adding some items to the list.

Congratulations, you have completed your first Vaadin application!
