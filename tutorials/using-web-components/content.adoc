This tutorial teaches you how to use and interact with web components. We'll build a small UI that adds people to a data grid.

Most Web Components, like the link:/components/browse[Vaadin component set], are distributed as ES modules. To use them efficiently, you need to have a build tool like https://webpack.js.org/[Webpack^], https://parceljs.org/[Parcel^], or https://rollupjs.org/[Rollup]. 

If you already have an existing project that handles ES modules, feel free to skip directly to Step 1. 

== Step 0: Build tooling

video::KXjA52xat7Y[youtube]

=== Create and init project

Start by creating a new folder and initializing NPM in it. 

[source,terminal]
----
$ mkdir webcomponents
$ cd webcomponents
$ npm init -y <1>
----
<1> The `-y` flag answers yes to all NPM init questions by default. If you want to customize the answers, omit this. 

Then, install Webpack and plugins: 

[source,terminal]
$ npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli html-webpack-plugin

=== Project structure

Inside the `webcomponents` directory that you created, create another folder: `src`. Inside of it, create `index.html`, and `index.js`.

Leave `index.js` empty for now. Add the following to `index.html`:

.`*src/index.html*`
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Webcomponents!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Yay!
  </body>
</html>
----

=== Configure Webpack

In the root of the project, create a webpack configuration file `webpack.config.js`:

.`*webpack.config.js*`
[source,html]
----
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = ({ mode }) => { 
  return {
    mode, <1>
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html' <2>
      })
    ],
    devtool: mode === 'development' ? 'source-map' : 'none' <3>
  };
};
----
<1> Configure the `mode` property. This will be set from the commandline and be either `development` or `production`. 
<2> Tell HtmlWebpackPlugin to use our index file instead of generating its own.
<3> Enable sourcemaps for development

=== Add scripts for running the app

Define two NPM scripts in `package.json` for running and building the app. 

[source,diff]
----
"scripts": {
-    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
+    "dev": "webpack-dev-server --env.mode development",
+    "prod": "webpack --env.mode production"
  },
----

After this, you can start a development server with `npm run dev` or build a production optimized build with `npm run prod`. 

Any changes you make to the source code are automatically compiled and reflected in the browser during development time. 

TIP: This is a very barebones setup that works well for development. You will most likely need to expand on it for your own needs with things like transpilation. The https://webpack.js.org/concepts/[Webpack^] documentation is an excellent place to continue learning about configuring the build.


== Step 1: Using Web Components

video::88Sa-SlHRxk[youtube]

== Install the components

The first step in using web components is installing them. In this case, we install `vaadin-text-field`, `vaadin-button`, and `vaadin-grid` from the link:/components/browse[Vaadin component set]. In addition to the components, we install `webcomponentsjs`, which is a polyfill for adding support to older browsers.

[source,terminal]
$ npm install --save @vaadin/vaadin-text-field @vaadin/vaadin-button @vaadin/vaadin-grid

Once the install finishes, import the components in `index.js` to make them available to your browser.

.`*src/index.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
import '@vaadin/vaadin-button';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-grid';
import '@vaadin/vaadin-text-field';
----


== Add polyfills for older browsers
Although most modern browsers ship with built-in support for Web Components, there are still users out there with older browsers. If you want to make your app available to them as well, you want to include _polyfills_ that emulate the functionality in browsers without native support.

The https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs[webcomponents.js^] polyfill comes with a loader script that can be used to load only the polyfills a particular browser needs. It loads the polyfills dynamically, so it cannot be imported directly as a JS dependency that gets built by Webpack, rather you need to copy over the dependencies and include the loader in your index file. The library also includes a ES5 compatibility script in case you transpile your app into ES5.

[source,terminal]
$ npm install --save-dev copy-webpack-plugin @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs

=== Copy polyfills
The first thing we need to do is copy over the polyfills. If you are using a different build tool than Webpack, refer to the documentation for that tool on how to copy over static assets. 

.`*webpack.config.js*`
[source,diff]
----
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
+const CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = ({ mode }) => {
  return {
    mode,
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html'
      }),
+      new CopyWebpackPlugin([
+        {
+          context: 'node_modules/@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs',
+          from: '**/*.js',
+          to: 'webcomponents'
+        }
+      ])
+    ],
    devtool: mode === 'development' ? 'source-map' : 'none'
  };
};
----

=== Load polyfills
Then, include the loader and an optional import for the ES5 compatibility script in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.

.`*src/index.html*`
[source,html]
----
<script src="webcomponents/webcomponents-loader.js"></script>
<script>
  if (!window.customElements{document.write('<!--');}
</script>
<scripsrc="webcomponents/custom-elements-es5-apter.js"></script>
<!-- ! DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENT, WE NEED ITS CLOSING MARKER -->
----

You are now ready to use web components in IE11+ and any of the evergreen browsers. 

== Use Web Components to build the UI

Once you have installed the components, you can use them like any other HTML tag. Replace the body contents of `index.html` with the following: 

.`*src/index.html*`
[source,html]
----
<div class="form">
  <vaadin-text-field label="First Name" id="firstName"> </vaadin-text-field>
  <vaadin-text-field label="Last Name" id="lastName"> </vaadin-text-field>
  <vaadin-button id="addButton"> Add </vaadin-button>
</div>
<vaadin-grid id="grid">
  <vaadin-grid-column path="firstName" header="First name"> <1>
  </vaadin-grid-column>
  <vaadin-grid-column path="lastName" header="Last name">
  </vaadin-grid-column>
</vaadin-grid>
----
<1> The grid uses an array of objects as its data source. The `path` attribute defines what property of that object should be shown in the column. 

Notice that we added `id` attributes for all components. Ids make it easier for us to get hold of them from JavaScript in the next step. 


== Listen for events and update properties

Now that we have all the UI building blocks in place, the next step is to add some functionality. 

Start by adding a `load` event listener in `index.js` that calls a function `initUI()`. 

.`*src/index.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
window.addEventListener('load', () => {
  initUI();
});
----

TIP: With any JavaScript, it is an excellent practice to defer work until after the `load` event to allow the browser to render all static content before running JavaScript. Using the load listener pattern is not specific to Web Components, but something that's worth doing in most projects.

A fair amount is going on in the `initUI` function, so let's look at what's going on step by step: 

.`*src/index.js*`
[source,javascript]
----
function initUI() {
  const firstNameField = document.querySelector('#firstName');
  const lastNameField = document.querySelector('#lastName');
  const addButton = document.querySelector('#addButton');
  const grid = document.querySelector('#grid'); <1>

  let people = []; <2>

  addButton.addEventListener('click', e => { <3>
    people = [ <4>
      ...people,
      {
        firstName: firstNameField.value,
        lastName: lastNameField.value
      }
    ];
    grid.items = people; <5>
    firstNameField.value = ''; <6>
    lastNameField.value = '';
  });
}
----
<1> Get references to the components with `document.querySelector`
<2> Define an array to hold the people that are added.
<3> Add a `click` listener on the button for adding people. 
<4> Create a new array with all previous people and a newly created person. The name values can be retrieved from the `value` property on the components.
<5> Set the new `people` array as the items property on the grid to display the updated data. 
<6> Clear the input fields. 

*Run the application, and you should now be able to add new entries to the grid.*


== Summary and next steps
Web Components behave like any other HTML element once you have imported them. You can set and read attributes and properties for data, and listen to events to add interactivity. 

Web Components are designed to be framework independent. You can use them together with a framework or templating library to cut down on the boilerplate of manually querying elements and setting their values. See any of our other guides on using Web Components in popular frameworks for further information.
