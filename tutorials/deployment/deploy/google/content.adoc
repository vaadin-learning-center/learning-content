The aim of this tutorial is to show how to deploy a https://vaadin.com/start/latest/simple-ui[Vaadin application] to Google Cloud. It is not an in-depth tutorial, but rather showing the minimum required steps to get things running and try Google cloud as a potential host platform for your Vaadin applications.

To get started, open https://console.cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud console], and log in using a Google account, then set up account information, you will be greeted by a screen similar to this:

== Using Cloud Shell

To keep things simple, and without downloading any scripts, we will be using the browser-based cloud console. To activate it click on the console icon on the top-right corner of the page then click on *Start Cloud Shell*:

After few moments, the console will pop up at the bottom of your project dashboard and ready to use:

You can treat the cloud shell as a remote shell, and we can start by cloning the source code repository and run it locally:

[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/vaadin/beverage-starter-flow
$ cd beverage-starter-flow/
$ mvn package
----

== Run the application

And preview using the *Web preview* icon on the consoleâ€™s top-right corner, then *Preview on port 8080*:

At this point, you can preview how the application will perform on Google cloud, share the session with other https://cloud.google.com/iam/[project collaborators], you can also set up an https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-change-notification[Object Change Notification] to update the local repository automatically once a specific branch gets updated.
