This tutorial shows you how to build a CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) applicatio using Vaadin Java API.

All you need is basic programming skills, an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE^] such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA[IntelliJ IDEA], and the https://jdk.java.net[JDK] version 8 or later. The tutorial should take between 20 to 60 minutes to complete, depending on your experience.

== Overview

We build a basic application to manage data about customers. To keep things simple, the application doesn't connect to a real database, but uses an in-memory backend instead. The concepts help you to understand how to use a real-world backend with the persistence technology of your choice.

The end result of the tutorial is a web page with a table (called a Grid in Vaadin Flow) that has filtering capabilities and the functionality to add, delete, and update customer data.

You can use the application as a starting point for more experiments with Vaadin Flow. For example, you could add new views, create a custom theme, use add-ons, and optimize for mobile.

If you don't want to code from scratch, you can https://github.com/vaadin/tutorial/tree/vaadin10+[download the final application^] and experiment with it.

== Installing the Development Tools

Make sure that you have the JDK version 8 or later installed and that it is up to date.

TIP: Most Linux distributions can use package managers to install the JDK. Windows and Mac users can download the JDK from https://jdk.java.net[jdk.java.net].

This tutorial uses https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], but you can use any other Java IDE.

If you prefer Eclipse or NetBeans, see:

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-eclipse[Importing a Maven project in Eclipse].

* https://vaadin.com/tutorials/import-maven-project-netbeans[Importing a Maven Project in NetBeans].

== Creating the Project

The easiest way to create a new Vaadin Flow project is to use the *Project Base* starter.

A starter is a ready-to-use project stub that includes configuration, dependencies, and example code.

To generate a new Vaadin project:

. Go to https://vaadin.com/start/latest/project-base.

. In the *Get Started* form, enter:

** *Group ID*: `com.vaadin.example`.

** *App Name*: `webapp`.

. Click *Download* and extract the `webapp.zip` file. If the button is not active, you may need to log in.

To import the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

. Click the *Open* option in the welcome window or select *File > Open*.

. Select the `pom.xml` file in the `webapp` directory.

. Click *Open* and *Open as Project* when prompted.

IntelliJ IDEA will download the required dependencies and build the project.

NOTE: If this is your first Vaadin app, building the project might take a while (depending on the speed of your network), because the libraries need to be downloaded. Maven caches them on your local file system and creating your next Maven-based Vaadin project will be much faster.


=== Viewing the Generated Project Files

Take a look at some of the generated project files:

* `webapp/pom.xml`: This file defines the project. It contains the configuration to build the project and declares the required dependencies (external libraries). The `pom.xml` file is the way Maven represents a software project. 

* `webapp/src/main/java`: This directory contains the Java code organized in packages. At this point, there is only one package, `com.vaadin.example`, that contains `MainView`: a Java class that implements the web UI using Vaadin Flow:
+
[source,java]
----
/**
 * The main view contains a button and a click listener.
 */
@Route("") 
@PWA(name = "Project Base for Vaadin Flow", shortName = "Project Base") 
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout { 

    public MainView() {
        Button button = new Button("Click me", 
                event -> Notification.show("Clicked!")); 
        add(button); 
    }
}
----
+
** The `@Route` annotation tells Vaadin to direct the root URL to this view. The URL parameter is optional and is derived from the class name, if not given.

** The `@PWA` annotation tells Vaadin to activate automatic https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps[PWA] features. This annotation is optional.

** The view extends `VerticalLayout` which shows components vertically.

** The `MainView` constructor:
*** Creates a button with the text *Click me* on it.

*** Adds a click listener (using a lambda expression) that shows a notification when the user clicks the button.

*** Adds the button to the `VerticalLayout`.

=== Running the Application

To run the application:

. Open the *Maven* view and locate *jetty:run* in *webapp > Plugins > jetty*.
. Double-click *jetty:run* to build the app and deploy it to a Jetty server. 
+
image::jetty-run.png[jetty:run Maven goal]
. Once the server starts, open `http://localhost:8080` to see the application in the browser.


[NOTE]
You can make changes to the code and compile the project, by selecting *Build > Build Project* in IntelliJ IDEA. The Jetty server picks up the changes and deploys them automatically within a few seconds. You can also reload the page to reflect the changes.


[TIP]
To make the deployment cycle smoother, many Java developers use http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/[JRebel] (commercial JVM agent) or similar, to allow smooth hot-code replacement.

If you want to use break points in your code, start the server in debug mode by right-clicking *jetty:run* and selecting *Debug 'webapp [jetty:run]'*.
