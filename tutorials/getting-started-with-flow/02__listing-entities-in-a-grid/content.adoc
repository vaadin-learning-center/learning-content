In this part of the tutorial we cover how to display data in a grid in your UI.

== Adding Domain Objects

Before getting into actual Vaadin development, we add the necessary domain objects and a dummy backend. In a real-world application, you would most probably have something similar implemented with JPA and EJB, or a Spring-based service.

The first step is to copy three Java classes from GitHub and add them to your project.
We use these classes to build the UI.

Here is a list of the files to copy:

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/CustomerStatus.java[`CustomerStatus.java`^]: This is a simple enum class
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/Customer.java[`Customer.java`^]: This this is the main domain object. It is the basic Java bean that we use in our example.
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/tutorial/vaadin10%2B/src/main/java/com/vaadin/starter/skeleton/backend/CustomerService.java[`CustomerService.java`^]: This is a simple service class via which you can request and modify `Customer` instances. Think of this class as the entry point to the dummy database.

[TIP]
The fastest way to copy classes in Eclipse is to use your clipboard. In your browser, select the text content of the class and choose *Edit > Copy*. In *Project Explorer* in Eclipse, right-click `../[packagename]#com.vaadin.starter.skeleton.my-app#` in `Java Resources` and choose *Edit > Paste*. Eclipse is smart enough to automatically create a properly-named Java file for the class.

[NOTE]
The actual implementation of these classes is not relevant for this tutorial, but feel free to explore them.


=== Adding UI Code to Show Data in a Grid

When building a UI for a data-centric application, you would typically start by listing the data from your backend. Vaadin offers several components and ways to do this. In this example, we use the `Grid` component to present our customer data in tabular form.

. Reference `CustomerService` and introduce a `Grid` field in [classname]`MainView.java`.

+
[source, java]
----
@Route("")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    private CustomerService service = CustomerService.getInstance();
    private Grid<Customer> grid = new Grid<>(Customer.class);

    public MainView() {
----

[TIP]
You can fix red compilation errors in Eclipse at any time using the *Source > Organize Imports* command. (shortcut (kbd:[Ctrl-Shift-O]).
 or kbd:[CMD-Shift-O] on Macs), you will be using it a lot in Java development. In possible class name collisions, always choose the appropriate class from the `com.vaadin.flow` package if you want to import core Vaadin Flow UI components, like the Grid.

. To list first name, last name and status properties of all `Customer` objects from the backend service, introduce a method `updateList` and replace the [classname]`MainView` constructor with:

+
[source,java]
----
public MainView() {

	// limit and define the order of properties shown by Grid
	grid.setColumns("firstName", "lastName", "status");

	add(grid);

	// make layout use full height (and grid expand to consume it)
	setSizeFull();

	updateList();
}

public void updateList() {
	grid.setItems(service.findAll());
}
----

. Save your code changes and refresh your browser to view the changes.
