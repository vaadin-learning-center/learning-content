This basic tutorial takes you through the process of creating your first web app with https://vaadin.com/flow[Vaadin Flow].

You need basic programming skills, an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment[IDE^] (like https://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse^]) and https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 8^] or later, installed on your computer to get started.

== Overview

In this tutorial we build a very simple customer management system to demonstrate basic Vaadin Flow development. The system has no real-world application and is for demonstration purposes only. To help you understand how to hook it to an existing Java-based backend, we use an in-memory "backend".

The result is a single web page, consisting of a table (called a Grid in Vaadin) with filtering capabilities and functionality to add, delete and update customer data.

You can use the result as a starting point for more Vaadin Flow experiments, such as using add-ons, adding a custom theme, adding new views, or optimizing for mobile.

The tutorial should take 20 - 60 minutes to complete.

As an alternative to coding from scratch, you can
https://github.com/vaadin/tutorial/tree/vaadin10+[download the final application^] and experiment with it.


=== Installing the Development Tools


* *JDK*: The tutorial uses Java 8. Make sure that you have JDK 8 or later installed and that it is up to date.
** Most Linux distributions can use package managers to install JDK.
** Windows and Mac users need to download JDK from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle's Java SE Downloads^].

* *IDE*: The tutorial uses https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse^], but you can use any other IDE that you are familiar with. Make sure you have the latest version installed.
** Choose the *Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers* distribution in the Eclipse installer.



=== Installing the Project Base

The tutorial uses the *Project Base* starter pack for Vaadin.

A starter pack is a project stub that has all the dependencies set up, and may also include sample code.

To download the starter pack:

. Open https://vaadin.com/start[Start a new project] in your browser.

. Go to *Latest Release* > *For Java Developers* and select *Project Base*.

. In *Get Started* enter:
** *Group ID*: `com.vaadin.starter.skeleton`.

** *App Name*: `my-app`.

. Select *Download* to download the `my-app.zip` package to your file system. If the button is not active, you may need to log in.

To import the starter pack into Eclipse:

. In Eclipse, go to *File* > *Open Projects From File System*.

. To select the import source, click *Archive...* and select the downloaded *my-app.zip*.

. Select *Finish*.

To build the project in Eclipse:

. In *Project Explorer* right-click the `my-app` folder.

. Select *Run As* > *Maven install*.

[NOTE]
*Maven install* initiates a full build of your application and creates a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)[WAR^] file in the `/target` directory of your project folder. You can deploy the WAR file to your application server when you go to production. In the tutorial, we use the Jetty Maven plugin to run the application locally, so there is no need to install an application server.


=== Viewing the Starter Files

You can view your project resources in the *Project Explorer* tree.

Note:

* `/pom.xml` contains the settings for building your project and declares the dependencies that are used.

* `/Java Resources/src/main/java` contains the Vaadin UI code.

** `../MainView.java` defines the application layout.
+
[source,java]
----
/**
 * The main view contains a button and a click listener.
 */
@Route("")
public class MainView extends VerticalLayout {

    public MainView() {
        Button button = new Button("Click me",
                event -> Notification.show("Clicked!"));
        add(button);
    }
}
----

*** The [classname]`@Route("")` annotation tells Vaadin Flow to direct the root URL to this view. The URL parameter is optional and will be derived from the class name if not given.
*** There is a button in the main view and a notification is shown when it is clicked.
*** The logic is attached to the button with a simple Java 8 lambda expression.
*** Finally, the button is added in the main view.


=== Testing the Application

To test your application, deploy it to a server that supports Servlet 3.1 specification. To test using Jetty Maven plugin:

. Right-click the project root in *Project Explorer* view

. Select [guilabel]*Run As* > *Maven buildâ€¦*.
+

. In the dialog enter:

** *Name*: `Run in Jetty`.
** *Goals*: `jetty:run`.

+
image:Jetty-Run.png[Generating a Maven launch for `jetty:run` target]

. Select *Run*.
+

. Once the server has started, open `http://localhost:8080` to see your application in the browser.

[NOTE]
If you make changes to the code, Jetty  picks up the changes and deploys most of them automatically within a few seconds. You can also reload the page to reflect the changes. In IntelliJ IDEA you'll need to manually build the project with defaults settings.

[TIP]
To make the deployment cycle smoother, many Java developers use http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/[JRebel] (commercial JVM agent) or similar to allow smooth hot-code replacement.
