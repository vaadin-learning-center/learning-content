Many developers form https://vaadin.com/forum/thread/17519898/17571651[the community] have requested a `Tree` component in Vaadin Flow. Apparently the component is not on the priority list for upcoming releases, because there is an easy workaround: a `TreeGrid` with one column. The purpose of this tutorial is to make it even more straightforward by providing a reference code to use for your `Tree` component.

== Show me the code

The code provides a shortcut to get a `Tree` functionality, by reducing a `TreeGrid` to one column.

[source,java]
----
public class Tree<T> extends TreeGrid<T> {

  public Tree(ValueProvider<T, ?> valueProvider) {
    addHierarchyColumn(valueProvider);
  }
}
----

Exactly, it's as simple as https://github.com/amahdy/vaadin-tree/blob/master/Tree.java[this code]. However, since it is a `Grid` under the hood, some coding mistakes can happen. I leave it up to you to decide to disable other methods like `setColumn`, `setColumns`, `addColumn`, ..etc.

== How it works

The trick is to force the developer to provide a value provider in the constructor, which is the member of the generic bean `T` that is taken as a column. We don't need to set a column header nor a caption since this is not a usual use case for a `Tree` component.
We set the provided value provider as the first and only column, and make it hierarchical.

== Example usage

Here is a sample code showing how to use the new `Tree` component:

[source,java]
----
  Tree<Person> tree = new Tree<>(Person::getFullname);
  tree.setItems(persons, person -> {
    if(person.hasLevel()) {
      return person.getLevel().getItems();
    }else {
      return Collections.emptyList();
    }
  });

  add(tree);
----

In the example above, the `Tree` displays the full name of all `persons`, and if a `person` has a hierarchy, then it adds it as a sub-level.
